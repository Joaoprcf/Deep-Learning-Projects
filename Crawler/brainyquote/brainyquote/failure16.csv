2,Sara Blakely,"I failed the LSAT. Basically, if I had not failed, I'd have been a lawyer and there would be no Spanx. I think failure is nothing more than life's way of nudging you that you are off course. My attitude to failure is not attached to outcome, but in not trying. It is liberating.","[life, attitude, lawyer]",failure
3,Guy Kawasaki,"Ambitious failure, magnificent failure, is a very good thing.","[good, ambitious, good thing]",failure
4,Yann Martel,"Every book I've written has been a different attempt to understand something, and the success or failure of the previous one is irrelevant. I write the book I want.","[success, book, want]",failure

6,Matt Taibbi,"The failure to work out sensible budgets makes it impossible for government agencies to make long-term plans, and instead leaves them scrambling to spend money in the short term.","[work, money, government]",failure
7,Nassim Nicholas Taleb,"Failure saves lives. In the airline industry, every time a plane crashes the probability of the next crash is lowered by that. The Titanic saved lives because we're building bigger and bigger ships. So these people died, but we have effectively improved the safety of the system, and nothing failed in vain.","[time, safety, people]",failure

11,Daniel Kahneman,An investment said to have an 80% chance of success sounds far more attractive than one with a 20% chance of failure. The mind can't easily recognize that they are the same.,"[success, mind, chance]",failure
12,Daniel Radcliffe,"I know it wouldn't seem like I've had a lot of failure in my career, but there are things that I regard as failures, when I look at certain performances and go, 'That's not good enough.'","[good, career]",failure
13,Bill O'Reilly,"Sociologists well understand that chaos at home causes violent behavior, educational failure and social alienation among children. Yet, many of us in America stay far, far away from this topic. That in itself is a national scandal. Bad parenting is gravely harming this nation.","[home, children, parenting]",failure
14,Rudy Giuliani,"Lincoln made mistakes. Roosevelt made mistakes. Eisenhower made mistakes. The Battle of the Bulge was the biggest intelligence failure in American military history, much bigger than any in Vietnam or now. We didn't know that the Soviets were moving 400,000 or 500,000 troops. We missed it.","[history, intelligence]",failure

18,Rob Thomas,"Having written both comedy and drama, comedy's harder because the fear of failure's so much stronger. When you write a scene and you see it cut together, and it doesn't make you laugh, it hurts in a way that failed drama doesn't. Failed drama, it's all, 'That's not that compelling,' but failed comedy just lays there.","[fear, together, laugh]",failure
19,Peter Diamandis,"If anyone has seen success and failure on a global stage, it's my friend Steve Forbes.","[success, friend, stage]",failure
20,Henry Petroski,"The paradox is that when we model future designs on past successes, we are inviting failure down the line; when we take into account past failures and anticipate potential new ways in which failure can occur, we are more likely to produce successful designs.","[future, past, successful]",failure
21,Nelson Mandela,"In the 1940s, traveling for an African was a complicated process. All Africans over the age of sixteen were compelled to carry 'Native passes' issued by the Native Affairs Department and were required to show that pass to any white policeman, civil servant, or employer. Failure to do so could mean arrest, trial, a jail sentence or fine.","[age, process, complicated]",failure
22,Solomon Asch,Most social acts have to be understood in their setting and lose meaning if isolated... No error in thinking about social facts is more serious than the failure to see their place and function.,"[thinking, meaning, facts]",failure
23,Ronald Kessler,"With the selection of Acting Secret Service Director Joseph P. Clancy as the director, President Obama has guaranteed that the agency will continue to lurch from one shocking security failure to another.","[service, security, acting]",failure
24,Jon Oringer,"You can't be afraid of the problem. Don't be afraid of failure; don't be afraid to make mistakes. Make sure you learn from each step; iterate, and stay as efficient as possible without being paralyzed by a difficult situation.","[mistakes, problem, step]",failure
25,Scott Adams,"If your current get-rich project fails, take what you learned and try something else. Keep repeating until something lucky happens. The universe has plenty of luck to go around; you just need to keep your hand raised until it's your turn. It helps to see failure as a road and not a wall.","[road, universe, luck]",failure
