5,Steve Harvey,"Women are the real reason we get up every day. I'm talking about real men. If there were no women, I would not even have to bathe, because why would I care?

6,Amanda Burton,"I could suddenly see the pressures all around; these endless magazines and cheap reality TV programmes poking at women, humiliating us for every flaw. It makes me so angry.

8,Jane Campion,"I would love to see more women directors because they represent half of the population - and gave birth to the whole world. Without them writing and being directors, the rest of us are not going to know the whole story.","[love, writing, world]",women
9,Gwen Moore,"As legislators and as Members of Congress, it is our obligation to speak up for those who are being ignored in our society. The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) does just that.","[society, violence, speak]",women

12,Erin Duffy,"The truth is, I can't help the way people perceive anything, from the role of financial industry in the economic crisis, to the place of women's fiction in the canon of modern literature, to the rank of mint chocolate chip ice cream as a favorite Baskin-Robbins flavor.","[truth, help, people]",women
13,Bill Cunningham,"The problem is I'm not a good photographer. To be perfectly honest, I'm too shy. Not aggressive enough. Well, I'm not aggressive at all. I just loved to see wonderfully dressed women, and I still do. That's all there is to it.","[good, problem, loved]",women
14,Candace Bushnell,"If I'm with a man, is that going to prevent me from achieving my goal? What sacrifices will I have to make in terms of being myself, if I'm with a man?

19,Steve Harvey,I think there are so many books out there written on relationships and romance that women are the authors of. How can women know exactly how men think?

20,Dolores Huerta,"My mother never made me do anything for my brothers, like serve them. I think that's an important lesson, especially for the Latino culture, because the women are expected to be the ones that serve and cook and whatever. Not in our family. Everybody was equal.","[family, mother, culture]",women
