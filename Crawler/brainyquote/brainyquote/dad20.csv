5,Geoffrey Rush,"Within our culture, every school has a swimming pool. We lived on the coast. People swam in the surf. It's a very sporty nation and at that particular time anyone who had an artistic bent was very much an outsider. So if you liked reading or ideas or playing the piano then your dad viewed you as a sissy, basically.","[time, culture, school]",dad

9,Brendan Fehr,"When you get pure joy out of 'being' rather than 'doing' or 'seeing', that's when you realize how big and unexplainable some things are and being a dad is one of those very few things.","[joy, doing, you]",dad

14,Dominic West,"I've hung out at dozens of playgrounds, bored out of my mind, with not even a look of comfort from disapproving mothers all around me.
