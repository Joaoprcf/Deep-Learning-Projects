0,Meg Cabot,I was the kind of kid who couldn't really stop making up stories during class. I didn't do very well academically because I was always drawing these little doodles in the margins of my notebooks and I wasn't bringing home the best grades.,"[home, drawing, grades]",best
1,Michael Heizer,"I think size is the most unused quotient in the sculptor's repertoire because it requires lots of commitment and time. To me it's the best tool. With size you get space and atmosphere: atmosphere becomes volume. You stand in the shape, in the zone.","[time, commitment, me]",best
2,Henry Selick,"Every kid has a toy that they believe is their best friend, that they believe communicates with them, and they imagine it being alive, their toy horse or car or whatever it is. Stop-motion is the only medium where we literally can make a toy come to life, an actual object.","[life, car, horse]",best
3,Alfonso Cuaron,"'Y Tu Mama Tambien' is one of the first unrated movies to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. But many video stores won't take a movie that's not rated, so I had to make the movie an R.","[movies, award, original]",best
4,Kevin Durant,"I like something simple and traditional, like dinner and a movie. The best way to get to know someone is to have a conversation over dinner. And steak houses have a nice atmosphere - the lights are dim, and they usually have a band playing.","[simple, dinner, lights]",best
5,Mark Cuban,"I look at my annual budgets for everything and anything, and I look to see where I can save the most money on those items. Saving 30% to 50% buying in bulk - replenishable items from toothpaste to soup, or whatever I use a lot of - is the best guaranteed return on investment you can get anywhere.","[money, investment, look]",best
6,Bruce Dickinson,"My dad always told me, 'I don't care what you do. Just aim to be the best at it. Even if it's the world's best window cleaner.'","[dad, world, me]",best
7,Steve Earle,"The idea that murder victims' families are best served by continuing the cycle of violence is something that I consider to be not only a lie, but criminally negligent. You lie to victims' families when you tell them they're going to receive closure if they participate in the process and witness the execution of a human being.","[violence, lie, execution]",best
8,Eva Longoria,I love being a woman. I love the sexiness we get to exude. But the best thing about being a woman is the power we have over men.,"[love, power, woman]",best
9,Maria Shriver,"My mother's death brought me to my knees. She was my hero, my role model, my very best friend. I spoke to her every single day of my life. I really tried hard when I grew up to make her proud of me.","[life, death, hero]",best
10,Naomi Wolf,"For all the power of video and film, I am not giving up my pen. I am just much more likely to try to link essays to webcasts or videos. The best way for these two media to move forward, to inform and make change, is in tandem; together they are more than the sum of their parts.","[change, power, giving]",best
11,Axl Rose,"'Appetite for Destruction' was the only thing written with lyrics and melody fitting the guitar parts at the same time. After that, I got a barrage of guitar songs that I was supposed to put words to, and I don't know if that was the best thing for Guns.","[time, words, guitar]",best
12,Marjane Satrapi,"You hear people saying, 'Oh I'm so tired, I've had enough of Cannes.' How can you have enough of Cannes? It's just the best place to be, like a fairytale.","[people, tired, place]",best
13,Rafael Nadal,"You fight, you try your best, but if you lose, you don't have to break five racquets and smash up the locker room. You can do those things, but when you've finished, nothing's changed. You've still lost. If something positive came from that, I probably would do it. But I see only negativity.","[positive, fight, lost]",best
14,Ron White,"I really understood a lot more about comedy after listening to Bill Hicks, who died at 32 years old. He's probably the best comedian who ever lived. Although you can't say that because of Carlin, Cosby and Pryor.","[listening, you, comedy]",best
15,Joyce Meyer,"When we trust God more than our feelings, it confuses the devil. I mean, when he throws you his best shot and he can't budge you from believing God, he won't know what to do with you anymore.","[trust, god, devil]",best
16,Hunter Hayes,"I'm very shy and awkward. I think the best thing is to embrace it. It's about accepting who you are and what you want to become and knowing all that you've got to work with, whether it's good or bad. My music was the only place I could be me for the longest time.","[music, work, time]",best
17,Luke Bryan,"My best artist friend is definitely Jason Aldean. He and I really get along great and are really great friends. It's fun to tour with a buddy and somebody that I just enjoy hanging out with. If we weren't touring together, we'd be hunting in the off-season still and knocking around doing stuff, certainly.","[great, together, fun]",best
18,Aeschylus,It is best for the wise man not to seem wise.,"[wise, man, wise man]",best
19,Napoleon Bonaparte,The best way to keep one's word is not to give it.,"[way, word, give]",best
20,Steve Prefontaine,"To give anything less than your best, is to sacrifice the gift.","[gift, sacrifice, anything]",best
21,Thomas Jefferson,He who knows best knows how little he knows.,"[little, how, he]",best
22,Vincent Van Gogh,But I always think that the best way to know God is to love many things.,"[love, god, know]",best
23,Pat Riley,"Look for your choices, pick the best one, then go with it.","[choices, look, go]",best
24,Graydon Carter,"Arrogance, ignorance, and incompetence. Not a pretty cocktail of personality traits in the best of situations. No sirree. Not a pretty cocktail in an office-mate and not a pretty cocktail in a head of state. In fact, in a leader, it's a lethal cocktail.","[leader, ignorance]",best
25,Orlando Bloom,"The best way to look stylish on a budget is to try second-hand, bargain hunting, and vintage.","[hunting, budget, look]",best
