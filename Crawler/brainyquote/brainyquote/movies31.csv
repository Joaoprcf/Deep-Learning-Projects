0,Bill O'Reilly,"Saturday night at my house, I often trot out classic movies and force the urchins to watch them. There is much wailing and gnashing of teeth, but I think it's important to teach kids about American culture, and films are certainly a big part of it.","[culture, night, american]",movies
1,James Caan,"I have nothing against these big CGI movies, but there are not enough of the other ones - the ones with stories about character that have a beginning, a middle and an end. I said that to a couple of studio heads and they said, 'That's novel.'","[character, end, beginning]",movies
2,Mort Sahl,I used to go to two movies every week for the Saturday matinee when I was a kid.,"[week, two, kid]",movies
3,Evangeline Lilly,"I got the script for 'Real Steel.' I started reading and saw that it was about robot boxing, and I was immediately turned off. It's not my thing. But I continued on, and by the time I got to the end of the script, I had chicken skin and tears in my eyes. I thought, 'Man, we don't make movies like this anymore.'","[time, eyes, end]",movies
4,John Malkovich,"Most filmmakers' entire body of knowledge is of other movies. When they describe things, they describe them in relation to other movies. That's why we have so many cyclical movies that look like other movies. But I'm not cynical. I even go to some of those movies.","[knowledge, body, look]",movies
5,Kim Cattrall,I don't know many women who can relate to Sharon Stone and the kind of movies she does. I don't know a lot of guys who can relate to Tom Cruise's movies because they're on a kind of fantastic level. I like movies I can relate to.,"[women, know, stone]",movies
6,Idina Menzel,"My favorite thing of all time is a New York City weekend when there's a blizzard. Everything gets really quiet, and everyone goes to the movies and the park.","[time, city, new york]",movies
7,John Cassavetes,"Commercial movies have no feeling, no sensitivity. Most people tell me people won't understand films with feeling. But everyone can feel.","[people, me, feeling]",movies
8,John Cassavetes,People don't know what they are doing most of the time. They don't know what they want. It's only in 'the movies' that they know what their problems are and have game plans to deal with them.,"[time, people, problems]",movies
9,Mike Nichols,"I loved all movies, literally. I certainly loved 'Shane' and 'Roxie Hart.' Later on, when I was less of a kid, I loved 'L'Avventura' and 'Persona' and all Fellini movies and like everybody else I loved John Ford. Then and now, I loved Preston Sturges, maybe above anyone.","[loved, kid, now]",movies
10,Chuck Palahniuk,The folks who read my books are so passionate about each one of them that the people making my movies are more afraid of my readership than they are of me.,"[people, me, passionate]",movies
11,Leslie Mann,I'm so sick of seeing these movies where married couples are just cuddling on the couch and caressing each other's faces.,"[sick, seeing, married]",movies
12,Clint Eastwood,"Movies are fun, but they are no cure for cancer.","[fun, cancer, cure]",movies
13,Clint Eastwood,"I like Italian movies. I was frequently there in the '60s, in Rome and the vicinity. It was a great period in life. I was very influenced by their stuff.","[life, great, rome]",movies
14,Dolly Parton,"My favorite movies of all times is 'Doctor Zhivago,' and I love 'Gone With the Wind.' I'd love to play some Southern belle or something where I owned a plantation.","[love, doctor, wind]",movies
15,Dominika Cibulkova,"I spend days on my Xperia logging on Facebook chatting with my friends and family at home; I love listening to Rihanna and Pink and watching movies. Basically, anything that makes me smile, but most of my fans will know that I am always smiling!","[love, family, smile]",movies
16,Dwayne Johnson,"Playing big, heroic characters with heart is always a lot of fun. I enjoy making movies like that, and a lot of people love to live vicariously through those characters.","[love, heart, fun]",movies
17,Virginia Postrel,"The profusion of fonts is one more product of the digital revolution. Beginning in the mid-'80s and accelerating in the 1990s, type design weathered the sort of radical, technology-driven transformation that other creative industries, including music, publishing, and movies, now face.","[music, design, beginning]",movies
18,Virginia Postrel,"Most of us cluster somewhere in the middle of most statistical distributions. But there are lots of bell curves, and pretty much everyone is on a tail of at least one of them. We may collect strange memorabilia or read esoteric books, hold unusual religious beliefs or wear odd-sized shoes, suffer rare diseases or enjoy obscure movies.","[shoes, enjoy, strange]",movies
19,Drew Goddard,"I feel that in horror movies, especially, if you don't care about the characters, you've lost the audience. No one cares, and it becomes a process of watching people get killed.","[people, care, lost]",movies
20,Drew Goddard,"I think that there's good movies and there's bad movies, and sometimes the bad movies spoil it for the rest of us, and we focus on them, but in the long run, all that matters are the good movies. Those are the ones that we will remember.","[good, focus, remember]",movies
21,Malcolm D. Lee,"'The Big Chill' had a bunch of really talented actors, a great soundtrack, and the college connections that the characters shared. It's one of those movies I glean something different from every time I watch it.","[time, great, college]",movies
22,Tom Wolfe,"I hate stories in which a person has an occupation and you never see him working at it, like all those marvelous Cary Grant movies where he's a surgeon, and you never see him in the operating room.","[hate, see, you]",movies
23,Joseph Mazzello,"People are always like, 'Oh, 'Jurassic Park' is on...' or 'Oh, 'The River Wild' is on...' I actually haven't seen any of my movies in a long time. Being more self-aware now, and being an adult, I'm a little bit embarrassed to watch them.","[time, people, river]",movies
24,Hugh Jackman,"When I made 'Real Steel,' the director actually had the robots in the monitor, so he knew where everything was. So technically, there's been advancements. But at the end of the day, movies are about story and characters, so all the other stuff is great, but unless you have those two elements, then you've got nothing.","[great, end, day]",movies
25,Adam Green,"Hollywood is a roulette wheel. Each project dictates what's going to happen for you next, and it doesn't really matter that your project is critically acclaimed or won awards or has fans worldwide. It's a matter of how many movie tickets and DVDs and on-demand movies that you sell.","[happen, matter, you]",movies
