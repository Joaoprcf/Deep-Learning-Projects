0,Fergie,"There is so much to do in my house, in every little corner. It's just like anybody, it's like one step at a time. I try to decorate one space and a pipe breaks or whatever - you know how it is.","[time, step, know]",space
1,Jerry Saltz,"When museums are built these days, architects, directors, and trustees seem most concerned about social space: places to have parties, eat dinner, wine-and-dine donors. Sure, these are important these days - museums have to bring in money - but they gobble up space and push the art itself far away from the entrance.","[art, money, dinner]",space
2,Lynn Margulis,"There is no scientific reason to think that we, even with space travel, are going to survive as a species for ever, certainly not by biting off the hand that feeds us, which is exactly what we are doing.","[travel, doing, think]",space
3,Tom Hodgkinson,"Faffing is good. It is an important part of life. Faffing is when we disconnect from the matrix and idle for a while, like a car. Our body and spirit know deep down that human beings were not made for constant toil so subconsciously creates space through the mechanism of faffing.","[life, good, deep]",space
4,Rebecca Solnit,"More and more I think of privatisation as being not just about the takeover of resources and power by corporate interests, but as the retreat of citizens to private life and private space, screened from solidarity with strangers and increasingly afraid or even unable to imagine acting in public.","[life, power, acting]",space
5,Rick Riordan,"If the parents are too busy to read, it's a safe bet the children will feel the same way. Set aside time for family reading each night. It doesn't matter so much what the kids read, as long as you provide them space for reading and a sense that it is a valuable part of your daily routine.","[family, time, children]",space
6,Tim Armstrong,"I think, from a standpoint of editorial, you know, AOL historically has played in a very deep way across many different verticals in the content space. Huffington Post adds a very large new dimension to that.","[deep, know, content]",space
7,Neil deGrasse Tyson,"Space in general gave us GPS - that's not specifically NASA, but it's investments in space.","[us, nasa, general]",space
8,Neil deGrasse Tyson,"If you want a nation to have space exploration ambitions, you've got to send humans.","[want, you, exploration]",space
9,Suzan-Lori Parks,"My plays are for the kind of black people who relate to funk music, to Parliament-Funkadelic. When those guys get out of a spaceship - the idea that black people are from outer space, there's a poetic truth to that. We are this vast people.","[music, truth, black]",space
10,Vanna Bonta,"Sex in space is not just a good idea, it's survival.","[good, survival, sex]",space
11,Ben Parr,"With every inch of land on Earth now catalogued by our satellites, the stars are the next place we as a species must travel. And with a booming world population that will hit 9.1 billion in 2050, large-scale space travel may become a necessity.","[travel, stars, world]",space
12,Peter Zumthor,"I work a little bit like a sculptor. When I start, my first idea for a building is with the material. I believe architecture is about that. It's not about paper, it's not about forms. It's about space and material.","[work, architecture, believe]",space
13,Bjarke Ingels,"I believe that architecture, as anything else in life, is evolutionary. Ideas evolve; they don't come from outer space and crash into the drawing board.","[life, architecture, believe]",space
14,Shirin Neshat,"I believe and support the feminist movement, but I am not generally interested in considering women's rights in relation to equality with men, or in a competition with men, but rather within their own rights and feminine space.","[women, equality, believe]",space
15,Ashton Kutcher,I certainly don't think I'm deserving of taking up space forever as a human. There's a whole generation of people yet to be born that are going to be so much more evolved than I am. I don't want to take up space. They're going to be better equipped to make the world a better place than I am.,"[i am, generation, world]",space
16,Pritam Chakraborty,"I was offered a few shows, but the money didn't work out, but I'm not very keen on judging such shows. I'm happy in my space as a composer.","[work, money, happy]",space
17,August Wilson,"I write for myself, and my goal is bringing that world and that experience of black Americans to life on the stage and giving it a space there.","[life, experience, giving]",space
18,Buzz Aldrin,"There's no doubt who was a leader in space after the Apollo Program. Nobody came close to us. And our education system, in science, technology, engineering and math, was at the top of the world. It's no longer there. We're descending rather rapidly.","[education, technology]",space
19,Buzz Aldrin,I think both the space shuttle program and the International Space Station program have not really lived up to their expectations.,"[expectations, think, lived]",space
20,Brian Blessed,"I'm a fully trained cosmonaut and have completed 800 hours training, which has made me the No. 1 civilian reserve ready to visit the International Space Station. I am determined to go up, and I want to explore the Moon, Mars and beyond!","[moon, training, i am]",space
21,Alain de Botton,"A city like London is sociable in a sense that there are people gathering in bars and restaurants, concerts and lectures. Yet you can partake of all these experiences and never say hello to anyone new. And one of the things that all religions do is take groups of strangers into a space and say it is OK to talk to each other.","[people, london, city]",space
22,Eugene Cernan,Some of the most exciting space education in the country is not coming out of Washington or New York or California or even Texas. It's coming from a place in Kansas called the Cosmosphere.,"[education, texas, country]",space
23,Eugene Cernan,"We will certainly see teachers, journalists, artists and poets in space. Whatever it takes to the be the best is what it will take to get you into space.","[best, see, you]",space
24,Chuck Yeager,"In 1966, NASA took over in space, and it has been a bureaucratic mess ever since.","[mess, over, nasa]",space
25,Mikhail Gorbachev,"Imagine a country that flies into space, launches Sputniks, creates such a defense system, and it can't resolve the problem of women's pantyhose. There's no toothpaste, no soap powder, not the basic necessities of life. It was incredible and humiliating to work in such a government.","[life, work, women]",space
