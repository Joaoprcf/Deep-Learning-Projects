0,Luis von Ahn,"People are good at figuring out what's attractive, and computers are good at quickly searching and finding. You put them together, and bang!","[good, together, people]",computers
1,Luis von Ahn,"The basic idea of Games With a Purpose is that we are taking a problem that computers cannot yet solve, and we are getting people to solve it for us while they are playing a game.","[purpose, people, problem]",computers
2,Luis von Ahn,"Science fiction has done a really good job of scaring us into thinking that computers shouldn't get too smart, because as soon as they get really smart, they're going to take over the world and kill us, or something like that. But why would they do that?","[science, good, smart]",computers
3,Dieter Rams,I don't like computers. I still like to do my drawings by hand.,"[hand, like, still]",computers
4,Jonathan Raymond,"Technology ventures can succeed with very little investment, unlike many other industries. A lot of the big Internet players like Google or Yahoo were started by a couple of guys with computers. Microsoft was started in Bill Gates' garage.","[technology, internet]",computers
5,Jack Wagner,"We all grew up, our grandmothers and mothers had about three channels to watch, so we watched those soaps and now, a generation has grown up with the Internet and computers and video games.","[video games, generation]",computers
6,Lennart Nilsson,"And my real enemy is not to hold the specimen sterile, but it's the lighting. The light is our real enemy. So we have to work with very very poor lighting. But we can increase the light with computers.","[work, light, enemy]",computers
7,Lawrence Kudlow,"I believe China is a major trade violator. The Chinese break all the rules. They counterfeit our goods, steal our international property rights, and hack the computers of our industries and government. Something must be done about it.","[believe, government, rules]",computers
8,Frank Tipler,"Future generations will know there's nothing mystical about wetware because by 2100, Moore's law will have given us tiny quantum computers powerful enough to upload a human soul.","[future, soul, law]",computers
9,Jimmi Simpson,"I'm really interested in the current tech world because of my brother Michael. Since we were little kids, in the 1970s, he was dealing with the first computers. He works for the government.","[government, brother, world]",computers
10,Sumner Redstone,The Internet is a powerful way to make lots of money... But we are not going to buy Yahoo!,"[money, internet, powerful]",computers
11,Francois-Henri Pinault,I closely follow everything about user interface or human-computer interface: technology that makes computers closer to the way the human being actually functions.,"[technology, way, follow]",computers
12,Dixie Carter,"Learning can take place in the backyard if there is a human being there who cares about the child. Before learning computers, children should learn to read first. They should sit around the dinner table and hear what their parents have to say and think.","[learning, children, parents]",computers
13,Joshua Michael Stern,"Doing a movie about computers between 1978 and 1982? You can't get much less sexy, less active than that.","[sexy, doing, you]",computers
14,Milton Glaser,Computers are to design as microwaves are to cooking.,"[cooking, design]",computers
15,Alan Cooper,"I have a cell phone that doesn't behave like a phone: It behaves like a computer that makes calls. Computers are becoming an integral part of daily life. And if people don't start designing them to be more user-friendly, then an even larger part of the population is going to be left out of even more stuff.","[life, daily, cell phone]",computers
16,Brenda Laurel,I don't understand computers. I've been unable to construct a working mental model of how they do what they do. I can break software by looking at it. I can blow anything up. Without trying. It's sort of like being a dowser. And this extreme elaborate clumsiness on my part is actually something people will pay me for. It's quite wonderful.,"[people, looking, me]",computers
17,Michael Birch,"When I was a kid, I really liked playing chess, which is pretty geeky; I just enjoyed it - thinking, exercising my mind. And I found computers to be like an eight-hour day chess game.","[mind, day, thinking]",computers
18,Godfrey Hounsfield,"I joined the staff of EMI in Middlesex in 1951, where I worked for a while on radar and guided weapons and later ran a small design laboratory. During this time, I became particularly interested in computers, which were then in their infancy. It was interesting, pioneering work at that time: drums and tape decks had to be designed from scratch.","[work, time, design]",computers
19,Shai Agassi,You can't have thousands of cars without good computers on the electric grid.,"[good, you, without]",computers
20,Eric Avery,"I started getting into Internet technologies and computers. I wasn't especially interested in being a musician, but I wound up finding my way back to being interested in music through computers.","[music, internet, finding]",computers
21,Conrad Wolfram,Computers do the calculating to allow people to transform the world.,"[world, people, allow]",computers
22,Conrad Wolfram,"Calculating does not equal mathematics. It's a subsection of it. In years gone by it was the limiting factor, but computers now allow you to make the whole of mathematics more intellectual.","[mathematics, intellectual]",computers
23,Jefferson Han,"As computers have become more powerful, computer graphics have advanced to the point where it's possible to create photo-realistic images. The bottleneck wasn't, 'How do we make pixels prettier?' It was, 'How do we engage with them more?'","[powerful, create, possible]",computers
24,Pat Cadigan,"I took this 'how to build computers' course basically because I'm sick and tired of getting ripped off by cheesy computer companies. Software baffles me. I like hardware. I used to change my own oil, and now I want to build my own computer so I can have what I want.","[change, me, tired]",computers
25,Beth Simone Noveck,"Starting early and getting girls on computers, tinkering and playing with technology, games and new tools, is extremely important for bridging the gender divide that exists now in computer science and in technology.","[technology, science, gender]",computers
