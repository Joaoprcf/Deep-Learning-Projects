I've sometimes had to suppress a smile when some young lady, who has obviously not taken care of herself through diet or exercise, says admiringly, 'Ooh, I hope I look as good as you do when I'm your age!' Although it's intended to be complimentary, it's actually a back-hander.","[hope, age, good]",smile

14,Chrissy Teigen,"Kanye is so much fun. He's a wonderful person.
