0,Mark Hoppus,"The last few years I became a lot more into sports. Growing up, the sports I liked were independent sports, like skateboarding. I was really into skateboarding, and not necessarily team televised sports.","[team, growing up, growing]",sports
1,Haruki Murakami,"Team sports aren't my thing. I find it easier to pick something up if I can do it at my own speed. And you don't need a partner to go running, you don't need a particular place, like in tennis, just a pair of trainers.","[team, partner, find]",sports
2,John Major,"If you look at things that really affect people's lives - sport, the arts, charities - they were always at the back of the queue for government money - health, social security, defence, pensions were all way ahead. And each of those areas - sports, the arts, the lottery - got relatively petty cash from the government.","[money, health, government]",sports
3,Jackie Joyner-Kersee,Growing up in the time of Title IX - it was passed when I was 10 - I got a front-row seat to so many great moments in women's sports. Of course I didn't know it at the time.,"[time, women, great]",sports
4,Jackie Joyner-Kersee,Competing in both track and field and basketball for the Bruins I have a lot of great memories to choose from. But my all-time favorite moment in collegiate sports has to be in 1982 when we won UCLA's first NCAA title in track.,"[memories, great, basketball]",sports
5,Joe Rogan,I never in my wildest imagination dreamed that I would somehow become a sports commentator.,"[imagination, never, become]",sports
6,Hugh Jackman,"I'm a mad lover of sport. You cannot say a bad word to me about sports. So I know business is involved and I know it can be cynical, and, of course, I watch it, but for me it's pure.","[business, me, know]",sports
7,Andy Murray,"Boxing, mixed martial arts and tennis are the hardest sports to train for.","[tennis, train, martial arts]",sports
8,Cory Monteith,"I'll go out, but I leave early, before the shenanigans. I don't really do the Hollywood party thing. I'd rather watch sports or play videogames or work out or sleep, to be totally honest.","[work, sleep, party]",sports
9,Fergie,I have to wear two sports bras when I do my cardio. It takes a lot to hold these puppies up!,"[hold, two, cardio]",sports
10,Harlan Coben,"I don't necessarily love the sports per se, I love the stories behind them. Also in a kind of perverse way I like to study what it does to us, why we care so much. It's caring about something that's utterly meaningless.","[love, caring, care]",sports
11,Chris Klein,"Actually, I always dreamed about getting a gold medal in the 100-meter freestyle in Olympic swimming. I always thought that would be the epic award in sports to get.","[thought, swimming, gold]",sports
12,Michael Ian Black,"My tastes in all things lean towards the arty and boring. I like sports documentaries about Scrabble players, bands that play quiet, unassuming music, and TV shows that win awards. In that way, I am an elitist snob.","[music, i am, win]",sports
13,Shawn Levy,"I just think that sports movies have such a built-in visceral, rooting interest, an epic win or lose redemptive quality. When they get it right, it can make for a really rousing movie experience.","[experience, quality]",sports
14,Luke Bryan,I'm a big sports fan in general.,"[big, sports fan, fan]",sports
15,Daley Thompson,"If you work hard in real life, people tend to get in your way - either from inertia or prejudice - and they stop you achieving things. It's the worst thing about real life compared with sports, where you generally get what you deserve: if you're the fastest guy, you win; there are no other games being played.","[life, work, work hard]",sports
16,Steven Johnson,"I suspect millions of people from my generation probably have comparable stories to tell: if not of sports simulations then of Dungeons & Dragons, or the geopolitical strategy of games like Diplomacy, a kind of chess superimposed onto actual history.","[history, strategy]",sports
17,J. R. Moehringer,"There's that old journalism rule that sunshine is the great disinfectant - which is how reporters bust their way into meetings and such all the time. In sports, I really think winning is the great disinfectant.","[time, great, winning]",sports
18,Will Self,"Most of us have had that experience - at around puberty - of realising that, despite whatever efforts we put into our chosen sports, we will become at best competent.","[best, experience, whatever]",sports
19,Mike Greenberg,"I would say my first golf memory was asking who Arnold Palmer was when he was always on the Pennzoil commercials. When I was a little kid I watched a lot of sports, but I didn't watch a lot of golf, and this guy was always on a tractor.","[memory, golf, say]",sports
20,Sharon Horgan,"If you're not the brightest or if you're not great at sports, or if you're not artistic, then you've got to find a way to make your mark; otherwise you're just this tiny little insignificant dot. I didn't want to be insignificant, so I made people laugh.","[great, people, laugh]",sports

24,Suriya,"I had this inferiority complex as a child, as I was not good at speaking. I was also not good in studies or sports and would often flunk in four-five subjects.","[good, child, complex]",sports
25,Kari Matchett,"I've always been into sports and yoga and running. I actually study a martial arts self-defense program called Krav Maga. I can't quite say it's easy, but it's fun for me and I love to do it.","[love, fun, me]",sports
