1,Muhammad Yunus,"Civilization has given us enormous successes: going to the moon, technology. But then this is the civilisation that took us to debt, environmental crisis, every single crisis. We need a civilization where we say goodbye to these things.","[environmental, moon, goodbye]",technology
2,Amy Klobuchar,"Who would know but ten years ago that kids would be texting each other all the time, that that would be one of their main forms of communication.

5,Ginni Rometty,"And so when I moved to IBM, I moved because I thought I could apply technology. I didn't actually have to do my engineer - I was an electrical engineer, but I could apply it. And that was when I changed. And when I got there, though, I have to say, at the time, I really never felt there was a constraint about being a woman. I really did not.","[time, woman, thought]",technology
6,Simon Mainwaring,"Refuse to accept the belief that your professional relevance, career success or financial security turns on the next update on the latest technology. Sometimes it's good to put the paddle down and just let the canoe glide.","[success, good, security]",technology
7,David Crystal,Ever since the arrival of printing - thought to be the invention of the devil because it would put false opinions into people's minds - people have been arguing that new technology would have disastrous consequences for language.,"[language, people, thought]",technology
8,Steven Pressfield,"Long-term, we must begin to build our internal strengths. It isn't just skills like computer technology. It's the old-fashioned basics of self-reliance, self-motivation, self-reinforcement, self-discipline, self-command.","[self-discipline, strengths]",technology
9,Sebastian Thrun,"I have a really deep belief that we create technologies to empower ourselves.

People are the number one entity there is on this planet.","[deep, people, belief]",technology
10,Neil deGrasse Tyson,"Once you have an innovation culture, even those who are not scientists or engineers - poets, actors, journalists - they, as communities, embrace the meaning of what it is to be scientifically literate. They embrace the concept of an innovation culture. They vote in ways that promote it. They don't fight science and they don't fight technology.","[science, innovation, culture]",technology
11,Neil deGrasse Tyson,"Even with all our technology and the inventions that make modern life so much easier than it once was, it takes just one big natural disaster to wipe all that away and remind us that, here on Earth, we're still at the mercy of nature.","[life, nature, earth]",technology
12,Zygmunt Bauman,"We already have - thanks to technology, development, skills, the efficiency of our work - enough resources to satisfy all human needs. But we don't have enough resources, and we are unlikely ever to have, to satisfy human greed.","[work, greed, thanks]",technology
13,Ezekiel Emanuel,"Patients who are being kept alive by technology and want to end their lives already have a recognized constitutional right to stop any and all medical interventions, from respirators to antibiotics.

15,Nathan Myhrvold,"My company invents all kinds of new technology in lots of different areas. And we do that for a couple of reasons. We invent for fun - invention is a lot of fun to do - and we also invent for profit. The two are related because the profit actually takes long enough that if it isn't fun, you wouldn't have the time to do it.","[time, fun, company]",technology
16,Martin Rees,Scientists surely have a special responsibility. It is their ideas that form the basis of new technology. They should not be indifferent to the fruits of their ideas. They should forgo experiments that are risky or unethical.,"[responsibility, ideas]",technology
17,Sharon Lawrence,"Technology has already opened the door a bit wider for filmmakers, with smaller digital cameras making production less cumbersome.
