1,Tracey Ullman,"Why does everyone think the future is space helmets, silver foil, and talking like computers, like a bad episode of Star Trek?","[funny, future, computers]",space
2,Sally Ride,"After the Challenger accident, NASA put in a lot of time to improve the safety of the space shuttle to fix the things that had gone wrong.","[time, safety, improve]",space
3,Ace Frehley,"When you take a shower in space, you have to press the water onto your body to clean yourself, and then you gotta vacuum it off.","[water, yourself, body]",space
4,Meryl Streep,"There are improbable things suspended in space, like the earth.","[earth, things, suspended]",space
5,Tom Hodgkinson,"When walking, you see things that you miss in a motor car or on the train. You give your mind space to ponder.","[car, mind, walking]",space
6,Zaha Hadid,Architecture is how the person places herself in the space. Fashion is about how you place the object on the person.,"[architecture, fashion, place]",space
7,Antoine Predock,"Underwater, I experience space with my body. I'll see a school of fish gathering and moving together and I'll exclaim, 'This is architecture.'","[experience, architecture]",space
8,Martin Rees,"To most people in the U.K., indeed throughout Western Europe, space exploration is primarily perceived as 'what NASA does'. This perception is - in many respects - a valid one. Superpower rivalry during the Cold War ramped up U.S. and Soviet space efforts to a scale that Western Europe had no motive to match.","[war, people, perception]",space
9,Amy Sedaris,"Sometimes, to keep things exciting, I decorate my house as if I owned a child. I'll toss a tiny pair of shoes in the hallway or lean small wooden crutches in what I refer to as 'the baby's room,' which is actually a tiny space where I make things. I continue to call it the baby's room because it confuses people and it's creepy.","[baby, small, shoes]",space
10,Deepak Chopra,"People need to know that they have all the tools within themselves. Self-awareness, which means awareness of their body, awareness of their mental space, awareness of their relationships - not only with each other, but with life and the ecosystem.","[life, people, body]",space
11,Wole Soyinka,"One has a responsibility to clean up one's space and make it livable as far as one's own resources go.

12,Jason Mraz,"I don't think love is a tricky issue at all. Love is best understood when we share: Share time, energy, food, resources, insights, information, whatever. It's usually thought of as something that exists between two people, but that's just because it's easier to see and feel in the space between them. Each person is sharing a lot with the other.","[love, best, time]",space
13,Neil deGrasse Tyson,"The partisanship surrounding space exploration and the retrenching of U.S. space policy are part of a more general trend: the decline of science in the United States. As its interest in science wanes, the country loses ground to the rest of the industrialized world in every measure of technological proficiency.","[science, world, rest]",space
14,Alan G. Poindexter,"I'm really hopeful about the future of space exploration and human spaceflight. Civilization as we know it has been defined by exploration. You know, we need to go off and find out what's around the next corner and what's just beyond what we already know. It's part of our being; it's part of our moral fiber to go off and explore.","[future, moral, know]",space
15,John Bonham,"I hate it when people slag us off. We had done three tours during 1970 and we finished off feeling we had just about had enough. We had done so much in that short space of time, we were drained.","[time, hate, people]",space
16,Wole Soyinka,"Under a dictatorship, a nation ceases to exist. All that remains is a fiefdom, a planet of slaves regimented by aliens from outer space.","[dictatorship, nation, planet]",space
17,Lady Gaga,"Every bit of me is devoted to love and art. And I aspire to try to be a teacher to my young fans who feel just like I felt when I was younger. I just felt like a freak. I guess what I'm trying to say is I'm trying to liberate them, I want to free them of their fears and make them feel that they can make their own space in the world.","[love, teacher, art]",space
18,Buzz Aldrin,"To move forward, what's required is a unified space agenda based on exploration, science, development, commerce, and security.","[science, security, forward]",space

20,Dan Quayle,"For NASA, space is still a high priority.","[high, nasa, still]",space
21,John Milton,"The stars, that nature hung in heaven, and filled their lamps with everlasting oil, give due light to the misled and lonely traveller.","[nature, light, stars]",space
22,Rod Serling,"There is a fifth dimension, beyond that which is known to man. It is a dimension as vast as space and as timeless as infinity. It is the middle ground between light and shadow, between science and superstition.","[light, science, man]",space
23,Wernher von Braun,There is just one thing I can promise you about the outer-space program - your tax-dollar will go further.,"[you, will, promise]",space
