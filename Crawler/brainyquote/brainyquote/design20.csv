0,Craig Venter,"In a biological system, the software builds its own hardware, but design is critical, and if you start with digital information, it has to be really accurate.","[information, start, digital]",design
1,Craig Venter,"Sometime in the future, I am a hundred percent certain scientists will sit down at a computer terminal, design what they want the organism to do, and build it.","[future, i am, want]",design
2,Craig Venter,"As the Industrial Age is drawing to a close, I think that we're witnessing the dawn of the era of biological design.","[age, drawing, think]",design

4,Venus Williams,I love design.,"[love, i love]",design
5,Venus Williams,"I've gone to school for business, for design, for architecture.","[business, architecture]",design
6,Zooey Deschanel,I just like music that sounds like music. Not like machines and computers and things that you design to make things sound slick and perfect.,"[music, computers, perfect]",design
7,Blake Lively,"My mom modeled and made clothes, so I always had such an appreciation for design.","[mom, appreciation, clothes]",design
8,Blake Lively,"Design, whether it's on your body or in your home, is the same thing. It's mixing different colors, different textures, and unexpected patterns - elements that you wouldn't often put together in an interesting way.","[home, together, colors]",design
9,Timothy Noah,"Steve Jobs was the greatest manufacturer of consumer products of his age. His marketing vision put him on par with Henry Ford, and his grasp of the aesthetic component to industrial design far surpassed Ford's.","[age, greatest, vision]",design

12,Nikki Sixx,"I love the way my tattoos look. I especially love Japanese-style tattoos and being completely sleeved by them, so it's not just these little individual and unrelated pieces, but everything's working together to create a larger design.","[love, working together]",design
13,Mark McKinnon,"America glories in its tradition of the self-made individual. Political candidates compete to be a friend to entrepreneurs, and policymakers, imagining the next Microsoft or Google, design laws to back the innovator in the garage.","[america, political, friend]",design
14,Mark McKinnon,"The problem with State of the Union speeches is that they are, by their nature and design, alphabet soup. It's hard to know what a president really cares about when they run down a laundry list and check every issue box under the sun for fear they will offend some constituency if they don't.","[nature, fear, sun]",design
15,Virginia Postrel,"We've gone from a world in which Starbucks set a cutting-edge standard for mass-market design to a world in which Starbucks establishes the bare minimum.

16,H. P. Lovecraft,"Write out the story - rapidly, fluently, and not too critically - following the second or narrative-order synopsis.

In liberal democracies around the world, this decision has generally been greeted with enthusiasm.","[government, world, decision]",design
23,Peter Singer,Most of the robots being developed for home use are functional in design - Gecko's homecare robot looks rather like the Star Wars robot R2-D2. Honda and Sony are designing robots that look more like the same movie's 'android' C-3PO.,"[home, look, robots]",design
24,Ellen DeGeneres,Designing is my hobby. If I didn't do what I do for a living - at some point when I don't do this for a living - I'll probably just do design work. I love finding really special pieces of furniture.,"[love, work, living]",design
25,John Malkovich,"You can be a mason and build 50 buildings, but it doesn't mean you can design one.","[you, buildings, build]",design
