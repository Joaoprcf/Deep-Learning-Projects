4,Katarina Johnson-Thompson,"Before training, I eat slow-release energy food, such as porridge or muesli, especially in the morning.

7,Sugar Ray Leonard,"At 14, I was the most disciplined guy around. I would get up at 5 o'clock in the morning and run five miles, and then go to school. Sometimes I would run behind the school bus, and the kids thought I was just crazy. I knew what I wanted.","[school, crazy, thought]",morning

19,Alan Furst,"We're the roughest people in the way we play and live, and that is because Americans come from people who all got up one morning and went 5,000 miles, and that was a time in the 19th century when it wasn't so easy to do.","[time, people, easy]",morning
