0,George Eastman,"If a man has wealth, he has to make a choice, because there is the money heaping up. He can keep it together in a bunch, and then leave it for others to administer after he is dead. Or he can get it into action and have fun, while he is still alive. I prefer getting it into action and adapting it to human needs, and making the plan work.","[work, together, man]",money

2,Yehuda Berg,"As children, our imaginations are vibrant, and our hearts are open. We believe that the bad guy always loses and that the tooth fairy sneaks into our rooms at night to put money under our pillow. Everything amazes us, and we think anything is possible. We continuously experience life with a sense of newness and unbridled curiosity.","[life, experience, children]",money
3,John Burdett,"I think it is immensely difficult to get the U.S. interested in non-U.S. topics.

7,Simon Cowell,"The secret of my success is that I make other people money. And, never ever, ever, ever be ashamed about trying to earn as much as possible for yourself, if the person you're working with is also making money. That's life!","[life, success, yourself]",money
8,Nick D'Aloisio,"My motivation has always been to do technology apps and companies, not making money. Just because the money's come, nothing's changed.","[technology, motivation]",money

10,David Henrie,"When I was young and it was someone's birthday, I didn't have the money to buy nice presents so I would take my mom's camera and make a movie parody for whoever's birthday it was. When I'd show it them, they'd die laughing. That reaction was a high for me, and I loved that feeling.","[birthday, mom, me]",money

14,Mark Cuban,"I look at my annual budgets for everything and anything, and I look to see where I can save the most money on those items.

16,Marjane Satrapi,I'm not a very good financing person. I don't even know how much money I have in my bank account. I never have opened one single envelope from the bank - they freak me out.,"[good, me, know]",money
17,Marjane Satrapi,"The movie business is not about the money. Of course, you need money to make the movie. If you have a small budget, adapt yourself. Having $200 million dollars doesn't ensure that you're definitely going to make a good movie. There's so many examples that prove that.","[business, good, yourself]",money
18,Steve Harvey,"All I knew growing up was that my father was married to and loved my momma, period. He worked hard, made some money, and put it on the dresser. She spent it on the family, and he went out and earned some more. He taught me the most about love.","[love, family, father]",money
19,Kelly Cutrone,"Society has a hyper emphasis on thin, and that trend comes from the consumers - it does not come from the fashion industry.

20,Ashton Kutcher,"I don't buy these rag magazines that feed off of stolen, you know, press. They're basically stealing someone's image in order to make money for themselves... They wait at the end of my street in their cars. Every time I exit my home, I have company.","[time, home, end]",money
21,Dave Matthews,"I think I'm probably a very sad man wrapped in a very joyful package, and I think I'm very resilient, and I think I'm quite generous, sometimes to a fault. And I'm very bad with money, but I don't see that too much of a flaw.","[sad, man, think]",money
22,Emma Watson,"Acting never was about the money for me... Maybe in 10 years, I'll be able to appreciate the fact that I am financially stable and independent and I don't have to make bad choices. I can be very picky.","[i am, choices, me]",money
23,Veerappa Moily,Saving petrol is saving India's money. This is a sense of patriotism. The country can be energy-independent by energy conservation. I appeal to the other ministers also to do this.,"[patriotism, energy, country]",money
24,Joel Osteen,"I purposely don't talk about money, because people are already skeptical about TV preachers. But I do say that I want you to be blessed.

25,Joel Osteen,"I believe God wants you to have money to pay your bills, send your kids to college and do charity work and build orphanages.
