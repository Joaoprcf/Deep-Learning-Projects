0,Mika Brzezinski,"I suffered from a mild case of postpartum depression after my second child and the physical challenge of maintaining an overnight shift at CBS, a marriage, and two in diapers made the symptoms worse and everyone in the house paid the price.","[depression, challenge, child]",marriage
1,Marilyn Monroe,Marriage destroyed my relationship with two wonderful men.,"[relationship, men, wonderful]",marriage
2,Kay Hagan,"Religious institutions should have religious freedom on this issue. No church or minister should ever have to conduct a marriage that is inconsistent with their religious beliefs. But I think as a civil institution, this issue's time has come and we need to move forward.","[time, freedom, forward]",marriage
3,Candace Bushnell,"My parents had a great marriage. Interestingly, it made it harder for me in relationships because I knew what a good relationship looked like.","[relationship, good, great]",marriage
4,Jon Tester,Montanans believe in the right to make a good life for their families. How they define a family should be their business and their business alone. I'm proud to support marriage equality because no one should be able to tell a Montanan or any American who they can love and who they can marry.,"[life, love, family]",marriage
5,Tracy Pollan,"Michael and I had great role models. Though his father has passed away, his parents had an amazingly strong marriage, as do mine. Both weathered really tough times. For us it has been normal to stay together through difficulties. We grew up witnessing that firsthand.","[father, great, together]",marriage
6,Pat Benatar,It was very difficult when I was trying to figure out how to have a marriage and babies and do this at the same time. There was no handbook. You were making it up as you went along.,"[time, trying, difficult]",marriage
7,Aishwarya Rai Bachchan,"Even prior to marriage and motherhood, it's always been about prioritising and focusing on what you can commit to. That's been my approach to every aspect of my life, be it my relationships or my professional commitments.","[life, motherhood, my life]",marriage
8,Maureen Dowd,"Obama sees himself as such a huge change that he can be cautious about other societal changes. But what he doesn't realize is that legalizing gay marriage is like electing a black president. Before you do it, it seems inconceivable. Once it's done, you can't remember what all the fuss was about.","[change, black, gay]",marriage
9,Jenna McCarthy,"I don't care how handsome or fabulous or funny the groom is, or how sweet and accommodating the bride, or vice versa. Marriage is hard.","[funny, sweet, care]",marriage
10,Niecy Nash,"Although my marriage left me with three beautiful children, it also left me with a healthy dose of self-doubt, low self-esteem, and an extreme desire to be loved again. I was operating on empty, expecting to be paid in full.","[children, beautiful, me]",marriage
11,Matt Passmore,"We're used to boy meets girl, boy likes girl, instant attraction on TV. But you throw a son in there, you throw a marriage in there, and you've got some really good character stuff.","[good, character, son]",marriage
12,Kirk Cameron,"Do I support the idea of gay marriage? No, I don't.","[support, gay, gay marriage]",marriage
13,Matthew Weiner,"I had a realization in the midst of my happy marriage that I had kind of lost most of my friends - my male friends in particular. And I started wondering if my wife, who was certainly my best friend, supplanted those relationships.","[best, happy, best friend]",marriage
14,P. J. O'Rourke,"Children live in the only successful Marxist state ever created: the family. 'From each according to his ability, to each according to his need' is the family's practice as well as its theory. Even with today's scattershot patterns of marriage and parenting, a family is collectivist to a more than North Korean degree.","[family, children, today]",marriage
15,Dolly Parton,The secret to a long marriage is to stay gone.,"[long, secret, gone]",marriage
16,Marianne Williamson,Marriage can be a magnificent lesson in becoming our best selves; that is true.,"[best, lesson, true]",marriage
17,Marianne Williamson,"In the hands of the ego, marriage is a prison. It is exclusive. It is a place where people are constantly reminded of their failures and limited by the energies of another person. It is rife with judgment and blame.","[people, hands, blame]",marriage
18,Shane Filan,"When you realise that money doesn't actually make you happy, it's a quick fix to have things you've always wanted, but then when you have it, you realise that's not what actually makes you happy. It's more about having a great marriage and happy children; that's what life's all about.","[life, money, children]",marriage
19,Francis Spufford,"In a hundred years, Christianity will have mutated into something utterly unpredictable which, nevertheless, we'd recognize immediately. And same-sex marriage will be one of the fine old God-given traditions that conservatives leap to defend.","[traditions, something, will]",marriage
20,Brooke Elliott,"I think a lot of times we're so told in our world that marriage is everything, and having a partner is everything. If you look at our movies and things, it's all directed around that love, and if you don't have that love, how sad you are.","[love, sad, world]",marriage
21,Anthony Foxx,I support same-sex marriage.,"[support, same-sex marriage]",marriage
22,Nancy Gibbs,"The Reverend Jeremiah Wright would baptize Obama, perform his marriage to Michelle LaVaughn Robinson, baptize their daughters, and draw him into the raucous, restless family of faith that Obama had never known before.","[family, faith, him]",marriage
23,Evangeline Lilly,"I have an American son and an American partner, so marriage might logistically make sense at one point. My partner is a stay-at-home father, so if he wants to be on my health plan, or tax wise, or maybe on paper we want to have our I's dotted and our T's crossed, but emotionally, neither of us really feels the need for it.","[father, health, wise]",marriage
24,Edwin Meese,"The United States is in a time of transition. Courts have redefined marriage, and beliefs about human sexuality are changing. Will the right to dissent be protected? Will the right of Americans to speak and act in accord with what the United States had always believed about marriage - that it's a union of husband and wife - be tolerated?","[time, wife, speak]",marriage
25,Chelsea Handler,"I have always maintained a strong opposition to marriage because I would have to be in serious denial to pretend I wasn't born with a personality for divorce. Whatever the opposite of amicable is, that's how my breakups tend to play out.","[strong, personality, divorce]",marriage
