16,Afrika Bambaataa,"What worries me are these so-called radio stations with program directors who don't play all the different flavors of hip-hop.

23,French Montana,I'm not going to go to a producer that's going to take me in a studio and charge me my whole budget and give me a fake head nod. I'm just trying to make good music. I appreciate everybody that's supporting me.,"[good, me, fake]",music
