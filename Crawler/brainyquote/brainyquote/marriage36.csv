3,Joanna Lumley,"I was 21 and had been going out with my boyfriend for two years when I found out I was pregnant - despite being told by doctors that I was sterile.

4,Joanna Lumley,It's so important to keep a marriage alive with small treats and doing little things for each other. Just remembering to say nice things and to have listening time is vital. That ghastly phrase 'quality time' means taking three minutes to sit down and be still with someone rather than yelling over your shoulder as you rush out.,"[time, little things, quality]",marriage
5,Michele Bachmann,"I think it's best if there's an amendment that goes on the ballot where the people can weigh in.

6,Michele Bachmann,"I do support a constitutional amendment on marriage between a man and a woman, but I would not be going into the states to overturn their state law.","[woman, support, man]",marriage

9,Edmund White,"First, I was opposed to gay marriage because it seemed like one more way that gays were wanting to assimilate.

12,Anna Kendrick,"I hate when people think you're broken because your parents are divorced. And I really reject the idea of staying together for the kids.

15,Mike Huckabee,"My kids have moved more in their twenties, you know, than my parents have moved in nearly 40-something years of marriage before they died. So there's a part of me that laments what we have lost, and that is a sense of community.","[community, parents, me]",marriage

19,Steve Carell,"I had a friend who, after 25 years of marriage, found himself trying to date again, and it was completely different. Everything had changed, and he had to reacquaint himself.

I'd see him every couple years.","[dad, mother, sister]",marriage
