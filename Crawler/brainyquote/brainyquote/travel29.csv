0,Christina Ricci,"We have so much pride in welcoming these passengers onto the plane, and they have so much pride in travel. It's something that I definitely always remember, when I'm playing a scene on the plane, just to imbue everything with that sense of excitement.","[pride, remember, excitement]",travel
1,David Blunkett,When I'm in London I do have the convenience of being close to St James Park which is also good for me because it gives me an excuse to get out and get some much needed exercise!,"[good, london, me]",travel
2,Mads Mikkelsen,"I like to stay home with my family. But travel is good in a way. It makes you redefine each other each time you see each other. Also, it helps that I think my wife is the hottest woman in the world.","[family, time, home]",travel
3,Jim Harrison,"Age focuses you. You are much better concentrated. There's more time when you travel less, don't do book tours, avoid interviews or public appearances. You walk the dogs, fish, hunt, cook and write.","[time, age, book]",travel
4,Michio Kaku,"Originally, the burden of proof was on physicists to prove that time travel was possible. Now the burden of proof is on physicists to prove there must be a law forbidding time travel.","[time, law, burden]",travel
5,Michio Kaku,"When you look at the calculation, it's amazing that every time you try to prove or disprove time travel, you've pushed Einstein's theory to the very limits where quantum effects must dominate. That's telling us that you really need a theory of everything to resolve this question. And the only candidate is string theory.","[time, amazing, limits]",travel
6,Michio Kaku,"I like to engage the public because when I was in high school, I had all these questions about anti-matter, higher dimensions and time travel. Every time I went to the library, every time I asked people these questions, I would get some strange looks. Nobody could answer any of these questions.","[time, school, people]",travel
7,Michio Kaku,"Time travel and teleportation will have to wait. It may take centuries to master these technology. But within the coming decades, we will understand dark matter, perhaps test string theory, find planets which can harbor life, and maybe have Brain 2.0, i.e. our consciousness on a disk which will survive even after we die.","[life, time, technology]",travel
8,Diane von Furstenberg,"I travel in so many different ways; I travel high, I rough it... it all depends on who I travel with.","[ways, high, different]",travel

10,Martin Rees,"Space doesn't offer an escape from Earth's problems. And even with nuclear fuel, the transit time to nearby stars exceeds a human lifetime. Interstellar travel is therefore, in my view, an enterprise for post-humans, evolved from our species not via natural selection, but by design.","[time, stars, design]",travel
11,Jenny Lewis,"I wouldn't call it a faux pas, but I have about 12 tracksuits. I always travel in a tracksuit. I feel it makes people happy when they see me.","[happy, people, me]",travel
12,Natalie Cole,"There's inevitably something missing when you grow up in this kind of an environment when your parents travel a lot. When your father is famous, you are looked at and expected of. There are standards you need to meet.","[father, parents, environment]",travel
13,Martin McGuinness,"Along with that ongoing process Sinn Fein took a decision to establish a peace commission which had the responsibility to travel around the country to receive submissions from the general public, also our opponents.","[peace, responsibility]",travel
14,Justin Timberlake,"The only thing that I travel with is an Ole Henriksen facial cleanser, something that my skin is used to avoid using different soaps at different hotels all the time, and Givenchy Man Pro-Energizing Massive Moisturizer. I usually keep my hair pretty short, too, so I don't require a lot of stuff.","[time, man, hair]",travel
15,Pete Hamill,Travel at least erodes some of the narrowness that exists in each of us.,"[us, some, exists]",travel
16,Roseanne Barr,I do kabbalistic meditation. It's not unlike time travel; it can change the past and not just the future. You can look at what was lost and go beyond the grief of what was lost.,"[change, time, future]",travel
17,Jeremy Corbyn,Riding a bicycle is the summit of human endeavour - an almost neutral environmental effect coupled with the ability to travel substantial distances without disturbing anybody. The bike is the perfect marriage of technology and human energy.,"[technology, marriage]",travel
18,Jeremy Corbyn,"I do not own a car, and my main form of travel to Westminster and in my constituency is by bicycle. I also take my bike on trains to meetings in other parts of the country, which enables me to see other cities and the other parts of the country.","[car, me, bike]",travel

24,Stephen Curry,"With all the travel we're doing to cold-weather cities, your mind definitely starts to wander. It gets you away from the game.

25,Stephen Curry,"I hope to play until I'm, like, 38 or something, and that's a lot of years in the game and a lot of travel and a lot of sacrifice on my family's part.","[family, hope, sacrifice]",travel
