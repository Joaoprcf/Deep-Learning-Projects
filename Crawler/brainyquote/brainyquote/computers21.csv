0,Graham Hawkes,"I grew up before computers. Computers are changing things, not all for the good.","[good, changing, things]",computers
1,Wesley Morris,"Computers are scary. They're nightmares to fix, lose our stuff, and, on occasion, they crash, producing the blue screen of death. Steve Jobs knew this. He knew that computers were bulky and hernia-inducing and Darth Vader black. He understood the value of declarative design.","[death, design, black]",computers
2,Ted Nelson,They were saying computers deal with numbers. This was absolutely nonsense. Computers deal with arbitrary information of any kind.,"[information, kind, nonsense]",computers
3,Marc Andreesen,"Google is working on self-driving cars, and they seem to work. People are so bad at driving cars that computers don't have to be that good to be much better.","[work, good, people]",computers
4,Sherry Turkle,"I think computers are the ultimate writing tool. I'm a very slow writer, so I appreciate it every day.","[day, writing, appreciate]",computers
5,Danger Mouse,I'm not really a knob-twiddler. I always work with an engineer; I'm not super hands-on when it comes to mixing boards and computers. I'm much more about what I'm hearing and what it needs to be like. I deal with songs and ideas and instruments.,"[work, ideas, engineer]",computers
6,Tim Harford,"How did the economy produce all these amazing things that we have around us - computers and cell phones and so on? There were a bunch of ideas, and the good ones grew and prospered. And the bad ones were pretty ruthlessly weeded out.","[good, amazing, ideas]",computers
7,Tim Harford,"Failure's inevitable. It happens all the time in a complex economy. And how did the economy produce all these amazing things that we have around us, computers and cell phones and so on? Well, the process was trial and error. There were a bunch of ideas, and the good ones grew and prospered, and the bad ones were pretty ruthlessly weeded out.","[time, failure, good]",computers
8,Roberta Williams,"Computers have become more friendly, understandable, and lots of years and thought have been put into developing software to convince people that they want and need a computer.","[people, thought, want]",computers
9,Thomas Dolby,So a more sensible thing it seemed to me was to go to Silicon Valley and be pushing on the technology companies to accelerate the use of audio and music in computers.,"[music, technology, me]",computers
10,Kevin Lynch,"A wide variety of devices beyond personal computers are arriving, many of which will be used to browse the Web... The Flash engineering team has taken this on with a major overhaul of the mainstream Flash Player for a variety of devices.","[team, engineering, personal]",computers
11,Roy Romer,"Interactive computers and software will, I think, provide a less costly method of doing some kinds of inquiry, in knowledge acquisition and even reasoning and interaction.","[knowledge, doing, think]",computers
12,Yael Naim,"Today, computers help us making the music. It's really a tool.","[music, today, help]",computers
13,Brian Kernighan,"Even though most people won't be directly involved with programming, everyone is affected by computers, so an educated person should have a good understanding of how computer hardware, software, and networks operate.","[good, people, understanding]",computers
14,Brian Kernighan,"It's important to be informed about issues like usability, reliability, security, privacy, and some of the inherent limitations of computers.","[privacy, security, important]",computers
15,Brian Binnie,"If somebody had told me when I was in graduate school, 'Brian, in 35 years you'll get a chance to fly the first commercial spacecraft with no computers,' I'd have said, 'I don't think so. People are not going to be that stupid.'","[school, stupid, people]",computers
16,Jeff Hawkins,I do two things. I design mobile computers and I study brains.,"[design, study, brains]",computers
17,Allan Savory,"Hard systems are everything we're using right now - computers, phones, planes, the clothes you're wearing, the room you're in. Everything there involves 100% use of technology and expertise to make it, and nothing we make - including space exploration vehicles and so on - is complex. Everything we make is complicated. Nothing is self-renewing.","[technology, space, nothing]",computers
18,Erik Brynjolfsson,Computers get better faster than anything else ever.,"[better, anything, ever]",computers
19,Malik Bendjelloul,I don't think 'Sugar Man' is a music doc any more than 'The Social Network' is about computers. It just happens to have the best soundtrack ever.,"[music, best, man]",computers
20,Greg Lynn,"Before computers, you'd start designing using shapes of cubes. Now I can start with something like a handkerchief, an object that doesn't have strong inside and outside boundaries or much closed volume.","[strong, start, you]",computers
21,Hod Lipson,"We've seen computers play chess and beat grand masters. We've seen computers drive a car across a desert. But interestingly, playing chess is easy, but having a conversation about nothing is really difficult for a computer.","[car, easy, conversation]",computers
22,Rony Abovitz,"We want the digital world to bend to your physical life, your real emotional life as a person, and we don't want you to bend to computers.","[life, world, want]",computers
23,Marcel Dzama,"Everyone was saying computers were going to be the future of art; everyone had to do something in this medium. And it was almost some sort of rebellion that I wanted to do these small, intimate drawings.","[art, future, small]",computers
24,Charles Keating,"Computers rather frighten me, because I never did learn to type, so the whole thing seems extraordinarily complicated to me.","[me, learn, complicated]",computers
25,Robert Cailliau,"The Web is actually a coming together of three technologies, if you like: the hypertext, the personal computer, and the network. So, the network we had, and the personal computers were there, but people didn't use them, because they didn't know what to use them for, except maybe for a few games.","[together, people, know]",computers
