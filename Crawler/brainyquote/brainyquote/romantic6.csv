3,Mindy Kaling,"When men hear women want a commitment, they think it means commitment to a romantic relationship, but that's not it. It's a commitment to not floating around anymore. I want a guy who is entrenched in his own life. Entrenched is awesome.","[life, relationship, women]",romantic

20,Jane Wiedlin,"I was a very romantic, overly dramatic young lady, which served me well as a songwriter.

And you say, 'But it is a sophisticated romantic comedy set in Paris.'","[love, dog, stupid]",romantic
