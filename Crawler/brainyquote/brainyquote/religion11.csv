16,David Bowie,"The humanists' replacement for religion: work really hard and somehow you'll either save yourself or you'll be immortal. Of course, that's a total joke, and our progress is nothing.

17,Elton John,"I love the idea of the teachings of Jesus Christ and the beautiful stories about it, which I loved in Sunday school and I collected all the little stickers and put them in my book. But the reality is that organised religion doesn't seem to work. It turns people into hateful lemmings and it's not really compassionate.","[love, work, beautiful]",religion

23,Ravi Zacharias,"I have always marveled that so many religions exact such revenge against dissenters.

If all religions were indeed the same, why not let someone be 'converted' to another religion?","[faith, revenge, someone]",religion
24,Dalai Lama,"If you have religious faith, very good, you can add on secular ethics, then religious belief, add on it, very good. But even those people who have no interest about religion, okay, it's not religion, but you can train through education.","[education, faith, good]",religion
