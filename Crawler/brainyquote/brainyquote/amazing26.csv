12,Jordin Sparks,"Since 'Idol' I've gotten used to having an amazing hair and make-up team around me, so I'm starting to get picky.

20,Alice Englert,"There is something about the South that accepts the supernatural. If you don't accept it and you're having a conversation with someone who does, it's just one of those polite things where you don't question their belief in ghosts. You just go, 'Oh, yeah, okay.'
