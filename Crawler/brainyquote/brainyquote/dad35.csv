1,Desmond Dekker,"One day, I went to buy something for my dad at the shops, and I heard a song by Nat King Cole called 'Stardust Melody.' It was like I went into a trance or something. I forgot all about my dad sending me to the shop. When I got home, I explained to him what happened. I thought I was going to get a whipping, but he understood.","[home, day, thought]",dad

3,David Beckham,"I would never complain about the position I'm in or the attention I get. At the end of the day, I'm very lucky to have what I have and do what I do, but I don't see myself as any different from anyone else who works hard and is a dad and a husband.","[myself, end, day]",dad
4,Beth Brooke,"My dad would always say, 'Girl, you've been given gifts. Use them.' And what he meant by that was, 'Don't just be successful. Don't just use your talents for your own success.

5,Chris O'Donnell,I think it's easiest to teach by example. My dad didn't tell us to work hard; we just saw how hard he worked. I know I have shortcomings - like a short fuse - but I've learned you can't come home from a long day of work and snap at the kids.,"[work, home, work hard]",dad
6,Danny Dyer,"I wasn't a bad kid. My dad left when I was young, so I didn't have much discipline, not that I'm making excuses. I was always out and about and had a good time as a kid, so I've done alright.","[time, good, discipline]",dad

11,Carlos Santana,"My dad's a beautiful man, but like a lot of Mexican men, or men in general, a lot of men have a problem with the balance of masculinity and femininity - intuition and compassion and tenderness - and get overboard with the macho thing. It took him a while to become more, I would say, conscious, evolved.","[beautiful, balance, man]",dad
12,John Boyega,"My dad's a Pentecostal minister, meaning that he's full of charisma. If he's telling a story about Noah's ark, you best know each tiger is going to be having their own little conversation and narrative.","[best, meaning, conversation]",dad

20,Randy Houser,"My dad wasn't the biggest role model, but he was a great musician and I loved him very much. He was a character.","[great, character, loved]",dad
