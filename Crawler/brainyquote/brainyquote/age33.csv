6,Juliet Rylance,"I come from a family rooted in the arts, so I think I naturally gravitated towards performing from an early age.","[family, think, early]",age
7,Meir Soloveichik,"Ours is decidedly not an age of Abrahams, Jacobs, or of youthful Elazars proud to be regarded as men of seventy. On the contrary, it is one in which the external signs of aging are avoided at all costs, youth is worshipped, and immortality is sought not in children but in Botox.","[children, men, youth]",age
8,Michelle Paver,"To experience the northern forest in the raw, I went to northern Finland and Lapland, travelling on horseback, and sleeping on reindeer skins in the traditional open-fronted Finnish laavu.

11,Erik Hassle,"The first seven years of my life, me, my mom and dad and my four older siblings lived in a suburb of Stockholm, and my mom was very active with directing theater.

13,Adoniram Judson,"It is my growing conviction that the Baptist churches in America are behind the age in missionary spirit.

15,Adam Christopher,"My own writing has perhaps more of an American flavor than a British one, but that's because the stories I've so far written have needed it. 'Empire State,' 'Seven Wonders' and 'The Age Atomic' are all very place-centric, where the setting itself is almost a character. But there is a universality to story that isn't just limited to science fiction.","[science, character, writing]",age
16,Robert E. Lee,"In this enlightened age, there are few I believe, but what will acknowledge, that slavery as an institution is a moral & political evil in any country. It is useless to expatiate on its disadvantages.","[evil, slavery, believe]",age
