1,Mindy Kaling,"I regard romantic comedies as a subgenre of sci-fi, in which the world operates according to different rules than my regular human world.","[world, rules, human]",romantic
2,Arthur Smith,"The Romantic poets were the prototype ramblers, and I've often found myself following in their footsteps - although perhaps not all of their footsteps since a typical walk for Samuel T. Coleridge might last two days and cover 145km.","[myself, walk, footsteps]",romantic
3,Sophie Kinsella,"I always thought 'chick lit' meant third-person contemporary funny novels, dealing with issues of the day. I mean, it's not the ideal term; when I'm asked to describe what I do, I say I write romantic comedies, cause that's what I feel they are. But I'm quite pragmatic.","[funny, day, thought]",romantic
4,Rufus Wainwright,"The Germany I was enthused with was more old fashioned and kind of romantic. I just got there, and the next thing you know, I had this huge gilded album. It was kind of an amazing experience because I didn't intend it to be that way.","[experience, amazing, know]",romantic
5,Eva Longoria,"I would say 80% of the scripts I get are dramas and not comedies or romantic comedies, which is funny because that's what I do every week.","[funny, week, say]",romantic
6,Antoine Predock,"The connection to place, to the land, the wind, the sun, stars, the moon... it sounds romantic, but it's true - the visceral experience of motion, of moving through time on some amazing machine - a few cars touch on it, but not too many compared to motorcycles. I always felt that any motorcycle journey was special.","[time, journey, experience]",romantic
7,Dhanush,I have played so many romantic roles that I don't know if I am really a romantic in real life. I get confused about the real me.,"[life, i am, me]",romantic
8,Caterina Scorsone,"My favorite - my very favorite movie, which I suppose is a bit of a guilty pleasure in that it's like, you know, every scene, you know, pushes every button, is 'True Romance' directed by Tony Scott with Patricia Arquette and Christian Slater, and it's a fantastic, fantastic film, very violent, very romantic.","[christian, know, true]",romantic
9,Rani Mukerji,I love romantic films and love drama. Any film that has romance or romantic element is my comfort.,"[love, comfort, film]",romantic
10,Jo Brand,"When I got married, the Sun ran the headline: 'Here comes the bride, all fat and wide.' Luckily, it was a few days after the wedding - but it was still hideous to read at a great romantic moment.","[wedding, great, sun]",romantic
11,Miranda Hart,"I am not married, no. I wasn't really into the notion when I was younger, but now I think a proposal is the ultimate romantic gesture.","[i am, think, now]",romantic
12,Rainbow Rowell,"When I watch a romantic comedy, I feel like they're selling something that doesn't exist. Two beautiful, but extremely unpleasant, people are terrible to each other for an hour, accidentally kiss, then decide to like each other during an extremely vague montage. That isn't how people fall in love.","[love, beautiful, kiss]",romantic
13,Luanne Rice,"'Little Night' has layers of meaning. There's something enchanted about night. All those heavenly bodies, shooting stars, the crescent moon, celestial phenomenon. Owls fly at night, and first kisses happen. Night is romantic. Alternately, darkness hides the worst of human behavior.","[stars, moon, darkness]",romantic
14,Oscar Wilde,"Romantic art deals with the exception and with the individual. Good people, belonging as they do to the normal, and so, commonplace type, are artistically uninteresting.","[art, good, people]",romantic
15,Susan Stewart,"The length and shape of the poemetto, like the greater Romantic lyric of English poetry, lends itself to retrospection and commentary.","[poetry, shape, english]",romantic
16,Thomas Moore,Romantic love is an illusion. Most of us discover this truth at the end of a love affair or else when the sweet emotions of love lead us into marriage and then turn down their flames.,"[love, marriage, truth]",romantic
17,Oscar Wilde,Deceiving others. That is what the world calls a romance.,"[world, romance, others]",romantic
18,Ashton Kutcher,"Vulnerability is the essence of romance. It's the art of being uncalculated, the willingness to look foolish, the courage to say, 'This is me, and I'm interested in you enough to show you my flaws with the hope that you may embrace me for all that I am but, more important, all that I am not.'","[hope, art, courage]",romantic
19,Rachel McAdams,I'm a hopeless romantic and I believe that you can find love in many different places and be very conflicted. I've discovered as I've grown up that life is far more complicated than you think it is when you're a kid. It isn't just a straightforward fairytale.,"[life, love, believe]",romantic
20,Maggie Gallagher,Romantic lovers require from each other at least the facade of reason: We desire to be what romantic love makes us appear in the other's eyes. We want to imagine we are deserving of the love we inspire.,"[love, eyes, inspire]",romantic
21,Samuel Daniel,"Beauty, sweet love, is like the morning dew, Whose short refresh upon tender green, Cheers for a time, but till the sun doth show And straight is gone, as it had never been.","[love, time, beauty]",romantic
22,Aaron Eckhart,"Yeah, but there's nobody who represents romance to me like Cary Grant.","[me, nobody, romance]",romantic
23,Michelle Trachtenberg,I don't like to search too much. I find it is easier when romance finds you.,"[find, search, you]",romantic
24,Warren Buffett,We believe that according the name 'investors' to institutions that trade actively is like calling someone who repeatedly engages in one-night stands a 'romantic.',"[believe, someone, name]",romantic
25,Chuck Palahniuk,"I'm always trying to reach a transcendent point, a romantic point, but reach it in a really unconventional way, a really profane way. To get to that romantic, touching, heartbreaking place, but through a lot of acts of profanity.","[trying, way, place]",romantic
