0,Rick Wright,"For me, playing music is like meditating - I just play and don't really think about what I'm doing, I just let it happen.","[me, doing, happen]",music
1,Brian Wilson,I have to tell you that J.S. Bach was easily the greatest musical innovator in the history of the world. He was so advanced for his time. There's a spiritual depth to his music. You can listen to it and it's like meditation.,"[time, history, greatest]",music
2,Danielle de Niese,"Music is as integral to me as my own DNA. My life has become a continual soundtrack, with music underscoring the most powerful and even the most banal moments of my life.","[life, me, moments]",music
3,Drake,"When I think of myself, I think of Toronto. My music would never sound the way it does if it weren't for Toronto.","[myself, think, way]",music
4,Noel Gallagher,"If everyone in the music business were brutally honest about what their intentions were then you could sort things out, but it's all smoke and mirrors.","[business, you, everyone]",music
5,Noel Gallagher,"I've grown to love California: It's the dream of every English musician to come here and work in the sunshine. To walk up Sunset Boulevard, knowing you're going to make music - that's it.","[love, work, sunset]",music
6,Psy,"I lived in the States from 1996 till 2000. I attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston in 1997. But I wasn't the most hard-working student. I rarely went to school. At that time, I seriously doubted that you could learn creativity in school. Music isn't something you can just learn from other people. Sometimes I regret missing classes.","[time, creativity, college]",music
7,Chance The Rapper,"The weird thing about rap is that you don't get compared in the same way that athletes do, even though it's probably the most competitive sport in music. In basketball, they look at a player and say: 'This guy was the best in his prime at this sport.' But in rap it's not until you're dead or retired that people think about it like that.","[best, basketball, people]",music

9,Wynton Marsalis,"The main three components are the blues, improvisation - which is some kind of element that people are trying to make it up - and swing, which means even though they're making up music, they're trying to make it up together.

10,Keith Richards,"About myself I have no great illusions. I know what I am. I know what I'm good at. I know what I ain't. I'm always hoping to surprise myself. But I do have a love of music and I do love to communicate it, and that's the best I can do, really. And I can raise a good family, too.","[love, family, best]",music
11,Wassily Kandinsky,"A painter, who finds no satisfaction in mere representation, however artistic, in his longing to express his inner life, cannot but envy the ease with which music, the most non-material of the arts today, achieves this end. He naturally seeks to apply the methods of music to his own art.","[life, art, today]",music
12,Maya Angelou,I write some country music. There's a song called 'I Hope You Dance.' Incredible. I was going to write that poem; somebody beat me to it.,"[hope, dance, me]",music
13,Kris Kristofferson,"I feel so lucky to have lived the life that I did and to be surrounded by the people I love. I've got eight kids, and they're always laughing all the time. It's like music to my ears. I think that my frame of mind these days is probably happier than I've ever been, which is kind of odd, coming close to the finish line.","[life, love, time]",music

18,Brenda Lee,The music business can be very cold. And it doesn't honor its elders.,"[business, honor, cold]",music
19,Randy Travis,I've learned the importance of loving what you do. I have also learned more patience due to the nature of the music business.,"[nature, business, patience]",music
20,Albert Einstein,"He who joyfully marches to music in rank and file has already earned my contempt. He has been given a large brain by mistake, since for him the spinal cord would suffice.","[intelligence, brain, mistake]",music
21,Oscar Peterson,"The music field was the first to break down racial barriers, because in order to play together, you have to love the people you are playing with, and if you have any racial inhibitions, you wouldn't be able to do that.","[love, together, people]",music
22,Herbie Hancock,Jazz has borrowed from other genres of music and also has lent itself to other genres of music.,"[jazz, borrowed, other]",music
23,Alice Cooper,"City people live the city. We live in L.A., New York, we live in places where it's chaotic and you never know what's gonna happen. And that's the music - you never know what's gonna happen.","[people, live, city]",music
