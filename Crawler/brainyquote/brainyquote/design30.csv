0,Jaron Lanier,"The wisdom of crowds works when the crowd is choosing the price of an ox, when there's a single numeric average. But if it's a design or something that matters, the decision is made by committee, and that's crap. You want people and groups who are able to think thoughts before they share.","[wisdom, thoughts, decision]",design
1,Jaron Lanier,"The basic problem is that web 2.0 tools are not supportive of democracy by design. They are tools designed to gather spy-agency-like data in a seductive way, first and foremost, but as a side effect they tend to provide software support for mob-like phenomena.","[democracy, support, problem]",design
2,Homaro Cantu,"I was just taught very early that if I didn't solve problems, I was headed for a very dark path. Problems were everywhere. Now, even if there are no problems, I look for problems. I'm like, 'You know what? I don't like the way this spoon works. I want to design a new spoon.'","[path, dark, problems]",design
3,Jamie Wyeth,"I had been elected to the National Academy of Design in New York, and one of the requirements was that you give a portrait, a self-portrait of yourself.","[yourself, portrait, you]",design
4,Miuccia Prada,"When I design and wonder what the point is, I think of someone having a bad time in their life. Maybe they are sad and they wake up and put on something I have made and it makes them feel just a bit better. So, in that sense, fashion is a little help in the life of a person. But only a little.","[life, time, sad]",design
5,Jasmine Guinness,"I have always loved clothes, and the opportunity to design my own line could not be missed. It's a dream job.","[opportunity, job, dream]",design
6,Rob Dyrdek,What's skateable is limitless by design.,[limitless],design
7,Henry Petroski,I have always been fascinated by the way things work and how they came to take the form that they did. Writing about these things satisfies my curiosity about the made world while at the same time giving me an opportunity to design a new explanation for the processes that shape it.,"[work, time, giving]",design
8,Henry Petroski,"Because every design must satisfy competing objectives, there necessarily has to be compromise among, if not the complete exclusion of, some of those objectives, in order to meet what are considered the more important of them.","[important, compromise, meet]",design
9,Steve Aoki,"There's a big gaping hole in the EDM space for songwriting. It's one thing to learn how to be a great sound designer and become big just on sound design. Especially if you're in the dubstep category, it's like, how much fatter and more interesting can you make those drops.","[great, learn, space]",design
10,Yves Behar,"Design needs a new relationship with the world, one that is more focused on our planet's needs.","[relationship, world, new]",design
11,Yves Behar,"When clients come to my design agency and say 'I want to be the Apple of this or that,' we say 'Okay, are you ready to be the Steve Jobs?' Few are up to the task.","[want, you, apple]",design
12,Yves Behar,My mantra is: 'Good design accelerates the adoption of new ideas.',"[good, ideas, new ideas]",design
13,Yves Behar,"What I learned from my years in Silicon Valley is that design can have a primary role in how a business is shaped, how a company can be design-driven. In my experience of large industry in Europe, that knowledge has been lost.","[business, knowledge]",design
14,Yves Behar,"I wanted to be a writer as a teen... so storytelling was my first love. In my late teens, design became an obsession as I realized that I could express myself through the medium. Much later, when I founded Fuseproject in 1999, our slogan became 'design brings stories to life.'","[life, love, myself]",design
15,Yves Behar,Design is a tool that either allows us to create new markets or disrupt existing ones.,"[create, new, us]",design
16,Yves Behar,"The best design work is really done when you spend more time with people, when you have the opportunity to be of the same mindset and the same incentives as the founder of the business.","[best, work, time]",design
17,Anthony Browne,"Maurice Sendak is the daddy of them all when it comes to picture books - the words, the rhythm, the psychology, the design.","[words, picture, psychology]",design
18,Yves Behar,"I think every business, really, has a unique reason for being, unique assets, unique attributes, a unique history. And that can be turned into a very attractive design story, essentially, that consumers can relate to.","[business, history, unique]",design
19,Yves Behar,I'm interested in technology for the masses. Good tech design should not just be for enthusiasts but for the general public. It should be something that touches everyone.,"[technology, good, everyone]",design
20,Yves Behar,"I am always looking for ways to move technology away from being over-featured. Moving to Silicon Valley in the mid-1990s meant I grew up as a designer in an environment where technology is a tool and not a means to an end. I believe that design should be driven by ideas, not style.","[technology, end, believe]",design
21,Yves Behar,"I have been working with Hive, part of British Gas, on reinventing the thermostat. Now you can control your heating at the press of a button on your phone. As I say, design should permeate every part of society.","[society, control, you]",design
22,Yves Behar,"Juicero is the first company to make cold-pressed juice something that people can make themselves at home. The challenges to design and engineer a press that can deliver 8,000 pounds of force are tremendous.","[home, challenges, people]",design
23,Yves Behar,"Integrating breakthrough technology into everyday products is always a challenge; at the same time, this is exactly how design makes tech products easily adoptable in life.","[life, time, technology]",design
24,Yves Behar,"I truly believe that we're about to enter a second golden age of design. The first one was in the '50s and '60s, when designers like Raymond Loewy, Charles Eames, George Nelson and Dieter Rams were shepherds of the brands they were working with. They had influence over the products and how companies communicated and promoted themselves.","[age, believe, influence]",design
25,Yves Behar,"Design accelerates the adoption of new ideas. And many of these ideas are important for designers to show that there is a way. When you see things through that lens, you realize it applies to any industry and any form of design.","[ideas, important, way]",design
