0,Daniel Libeskind,"Well, I think one doesn't really have to invent this memorial space, because it is already there. And it is speaking with a voice and, you know, 4 million of us came to see the site.","[voice, know, think]",space
1,Annie Leibovitz,I don't think there is anything wrong with white space. I don't think it's a problem to have a blank wall.,"[design, problem, think]",space
2,Doris Lessing,Space or science fiction has become a dialect for our time.,"[time, science, fiction]",space
3,Jean Giraudoux,"A golf course is the epitome of all that is purely transitory in the universe; a space not to dwell in, but to get over as quickly as possible.","[golf, universe, possible]",space
4,Eduardo Chillida,"Boundaries are actually the main factor in space, just as the present, another boundary, is the main factor in time.","[time, present, boundaries]",space
5,Freddy Adu,"I wanted to get us a place of our own with a little bit more space. The kitchen is just huge, because my mom... lives there, man, and she loves being in the kitchen.","[mom, man, she]",space
6,Eugene Cernan,"Today, we are on a path of decay. We are seeing the book close on five decades of accomplishment as the leader in human space exploration.","[today, leader, path]",space
7,George Osborne,"You really have to try hard to create space and, at least for a time, stop the political world from rushing in. The important thing is to remain sane.","[time, political, world]",space
8,Pippa Middleton,"When hosting a party, move any clutter from the space where you're entertaining.","[party, you, move]",space
9,Iain Sinclair,"The negotiation of city space has been made more difficult with the idea that redevelopment is an improvement for some vague future - but it's never like that, is it? Once you get there, for economic reasons you have to generate the next project - so you're immediately starting to dig up something else, and so it goes on.","[future, improvement, city]",space
10,Andrew O'Hagan,"A theatre is not a blank page for editorial, it is not a soapbox or a Tannoy system: it is a conscience that wakes with what is happening in the space, and wakes further still in response to what people are making of it.","[theatre, people, page]",space
11,Rebecca Solnit,"As I started to pursue the subject more deeply I realized that walking was this wonderful meandering path through everything I was already interested in - gender politics, public space and urban life, demonstrations and parades and marches. The relationship between walking and thinking and between the mind and the body.","[life, relationship, politics]",space
12,Zadie Smith,Well-run libraries are filled with people because what a good library offers cannot be easily found elsewhere: an indoor public space in which you do not have to buy anything in order to stay.,"[good, people, library]",space
13,Nathan Myhrvold,"Most visions of extraterrestrial life are actually steeped in human hubris. The fictional extraterrestrials of 'Star Trek' or a hundred other space operas are less alien than many of my neighbors. And funny, the ones running the place are mostly WASPish men.","[life, funny, men]",space
14,Antony Gormley,"I would say that the whole way that I have approached the body is as a space, not a thing - not an object to be improved, idealised or whatever, but simply to be dwelt in.","[body, way, say]",space
15,Tom DeLonge,"Angels and Airwaves is a complete, pure reflection of who I am. The philosophy, the spiritualism, the esotericism, the idea of hope and space and the themes about life and grandeur... that's all me.","[life, hope, reflection]",space

17,Jose Saramago,"I think the novel is not so much a literary genre, but a literary space, like a sea that is filled by many rivers. The novel receives streams of science, philosophy, poetry and contains all of these; it's not simply telling a story.","[science, poetry, sea]",space

20,Alfonso Cuaron,"A lot of the films I like are more than fantasies - they're movies fascinated by the technology of space exploration, and they try to honor the laws of physics. I watched the Gregory Peck movie 'Marooned' over and over when I was a kid.","[technology, honor, movies]",space
21,Ryan Holmes,"While social media skills were once a 'nice-to-have,' accreditation in the space is becoming a requirement for many of these job titles.

23,Neil deGrasse Tyson,"There are a lot of things you can do in space, and space essentially is unlimited resources. We are climbing over ourselves here looking for the next source of energy. The universe has an unlimited source of energy.","[universe, looking, energy]",space
24,Richard Dawkins,"Science has taught us, against all intuition, that apparently solid things like crystals and rocks are really almost entirely composed of empty space. And the familiar illustration is the nucleus of an atom is a fly in the middle of a sports stadium, and the next atom is in the next sports stadium.","[science, sports, fly]",space
25,Stephen Hawking,A zero-gravity flight is a first step toward space travel.,"[travel, step, first step]",space
