9,P. J. O'Rourke,"All religions must be made child-proof. Our teachers' unions have done good work in this field, K through 12. Delaying first communions and bar mitzvahs until age 21 would be another positive step.","[positive, work, good]",age
10,Doug Harvey,"My mom beat us until she started breaking clothes hangers. Wooden clothes hangers! Once we started laughing back at her, then your spankings were through. That's the way I was raised.

17,Martha Beck,"There are several ways to mess up your life by fighting to make your calendar age match your felt age.

18,Laura Prepon,"I've realized how important it is to have women in your life. You get to a certain age where you're like, 'I need women around.'","[life, women, important]",age
19,Megan McCafferty,"I think about all my scenes. I do so much revising as I go along; I wonder how I could write books if I hadn't grown up in the computer age.

24,Jose Carreras,"The voice is like a man, like ourselves: we all feel melancholic about what we have lost, the things we could do when we were young.
