0,David Chipperfield,"I like to be surrounded by books. My wife Evelyn has a Ph.D. in comparative literature, so we have a lot of her Spanish and German literature books which are wasted on me, plus a lot of novels and books on art and architecture shared by us both. Evelyn used to edit an art magazine called 'FMR,' so we have a common interest in design.","[art, design, wife]",architecture
1,David Chipperfield,"I suppose I'm trying to build an architecture that's as timeless as possible, although we're all creatures of our age.","[age, trying, possible]",architecture
2,David Chipperfield,A building is no good if someone's got to explain to you why it's good. You can't say you don't know enough about architecture - that's ridiculous. It's got to work on many levels.,"[work, good, building]",architecture
3,David Chipperfield,"Seeing architecture differently from the way you see the rest of life is a bit weird. I believe one should be consistent in all that one does, from the books you read to the way you bring up your children. Everything you do is connected.","[life, children, believe]",architecture
4,Michael Arad,"As architects we are often involved in the concrete-steel-and-glass aspect of it, but cities are social structures, and to be involved in imagining the future of cities and the type of relationships and the types of places that we're making is something that intrigues me very much.","[future, me, relationships]",architecture
5,Moshe Safdie,Architecture is changing faster than some other professions.,"[changing, faster, other]",architecture
6,Moshe Safdie,There is a profound ethic to architecture which is different from the other arts.,"[profound, arts, different]",architecture
7,Moshe Safdie,"Architecture should be rooted in the past, and yet be part of our own time and forward looking.","[time, past, looking]",architecture
8,Moshe Safdie,"Architecture has joined the world of fashion, but fashion is passing and architecture is timeless.","[world, fashion, passing]",architecture
9,Alan Huffman,"Architecture students are generally given theoretical projects, often located at distant locations, and told to come up with a design.","[design, students, projects]",architecture
10,I. M. Pei,It is good to learn from the ancients. I'm a bit of an ancient myself. They had a lot of time to think about architecture and landscape.,"[time, good, myself]",architecture
11,I. M. Pei,"Modern architecture needed to be part of an evolutionary, not a revolutionary, process.","[process, modern, needed]",architecture
12,I. M. Pei,A lasting architecture has to have roots.,"[roots, lasting]",architecture
13,I. M. Pei,I think the artistic side of architecture was natural to me. My mother was an artist and a poet.,"[mother, me, artist]",architecture
14,I. M. Pei,I've never left China. My family's been there for 600 years. But my architecture is not consciously Chinese in any sense. I'm a western architect.,"[family, china, never]",architecture
15,I. M. Pei,"I came, I studied architecture in America, so my technical background's completely western. But my seventeen years, the formative years of one's life, and I can't say that the Chineseness in me is not there.","[life, america, me]",architecture
16,I. M. Pei,"To me, form doesn't always follow function. Form has a life of its own, and at times, it may be the motivating force in design. When you're dealing with form as a sculptor, you feel that you are quite free in attempting to mould and shape things you want to do, but in architecture, it's much more difficult because it has to have a function.","[life, design, me]",architecture
17,I. M. Pei,"The essence of architecture is form and space, and light is the essential element to the key to architectural design, probably more important than anything. Technology and materials are secondary.","[technology, light, design]",architecture
18,I. M. Pei,"In northern architecture - the cathedrals of Europe and all the little churches - the details, the carving of stone, become necessary because the light is not there to help you very much. You have to enrich surfaces. The desert reduces form to its simplest nature. There is no need for gargoyles or flying buttresses in the desert.","[nature, light, help]",architecture
19,I. M. Pei,Architecture must not do violence to space or its neighbors.,"[violence, space, neighbors]",architecture
20,Jay Griffiths,"Society understands the architecture of academia and knows there are relevant qualifications in different fields, and the media accepts the idea of specialisations and accords greater respect to those with greater expertise. With one exception: climate science.","[respect, science, society]",architecture
21,Oksana Baiul,"One of my favorite vacation places is Miami, because of the people, the water and the beach - of course - and the architecture on Miami Beach is so wonderful.","[water, vacation, beach]",architecture
22,Annabelle Selldorf,"Architecture is about aging well, about precision and authenticity. There is much more to the success of a building than what you can see. I'm not suggesting that gestural architecture is always superficial, but solid reasoning has its place.","[success, building, see]",architecture
23,Annabelle Selldorf,"When you have rules to abide by, does that curtail you as a designer, or set you free? People think of classical architecture visually, but I think the brilliant part of it is actually spatial.","[people, rules, free]",architecture
24,Annabelle Selldorf,There's no architect who doesn't want to build a library - and I am no different. With so much scrutiny now attached to reading - because of technology and how we approach it as a social activity - that is a very exciting area in architecture.,"[technology, i am, reading]",architecture
25,Annabelle Selldorf,"Tension is an interesting quality - and architecture must have it. There should be elements of the inexplicable, the mysterious, and the poetic in something that is perfectly rational.","[quality, interesting]",architecture
