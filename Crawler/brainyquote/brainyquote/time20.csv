1,David Bowie,"What I do is I write mainly about very personal and rather lonely feelings, and I explore them in a different way each time. You know, what I do is not terribly intellectual.

6,David Rudisha,"I was still young when I missed Beijing. I was favourite to win a medal but I knew I had time. My coach advised me to stay at school and finish my exams. Even if I had gone and won the Olympics, I might not have handled the pressure. So I moved on.","[school, finish, me]",time
7,Colin Quinn,"Humanity is a crazy contradiction. I accept us for who we are. We're not that great. Every time we take a step forward we go back to the same primitive behavior. We're meant to be this way. It's not our fault, it's just who we are.","[great, humanity, crazy]",time

15,Lewis Thomas,"We tend to think of our selves as the only wholly unique creations in nature, but it is not so.

21,Mikhail Baryshnikov,"I was very restless. I really wanted to be a part of a kind of a progressive society.

25,Ginni Rometty,"Today when I think about diversity, I actually think about the word 'inclusion.' And I think this is a time of great inclusion. It's not men, it's not women alone.
