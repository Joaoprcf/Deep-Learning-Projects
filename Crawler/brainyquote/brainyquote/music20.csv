0,Joel Osteen,"Yes, the Bible should be taught in our schools because it is necessary to understand the Bible if we are to truly understand our own culture and how it came to be.

1,Glenn Danzig,"Al Gore wanted to tell people what they could listen to and what they couldn't, what they could record.

6,Brian May,"I think music is about our internal life. It's part of the way people touch each other. That's very precious to me. And astronomy is, in a sense, the very opposite thing. Instead of looking inwards, you are looking out, to things beyond our grasp.","[life, people, looking]",music
7,Wynton Marsalis,"I never minded giving my opinions. They are just opinions, and I had studied music and I had strong feelings. I was happy for my opinions to join all the other opinions.

8,Bonnie Raitt,"Especially girls, but any kids exposed to music programs and arts programs do much better on their tests. They have a better chance of going to college. They can focus better.

All of that's great, but you've got to build a whole person.","[work, learning, science]",music
9,John Zorn,"I used to look at composing music as problem solving. But as I get older, it's not about problem solving anymore. There are no solutions, because there are no problems. You just turn the tap and it flows out.","[problem, problems, look]",music
10,Rod Stewart,I'm proud to be a railway modeler. It means more to me to be on the cover of Model Railroader than to be on the cover of a music magazine.,"[proud, me, magazine]",music

12,Mary J. Blige,"I've done well, I've been disappointed, and I think it all goes back to you. Of course the labels are going to be the labels. It's the music business. You are a business. That's what they do. So you've got to protect yourself.","[business, yourself, think]",music
13,Mary J. Blige,"From being a little girl in the projects, going through all of the mess that I was going through, to ending up at the Inauguration for the first African-American president, I'm speechless right now because I never thought I'd - I never ever - I couldn't even see that far. Even when I ended up in the music business, I couldn't see that.","[business, girl, thought]",music
14,Josh Homme,Music is the only thing I've ever known that doesn't have any rules at all.,"[rules, only, thing]",music
15,Sam Abell,"There are a lot of ways to be expressive in life, but I wasn't good at some of them. Music, for instance. I was a distinct failure with the cello. Eventually, my parents sold the cello and bought a vacuum cleaner. The sound in our home improved.","[life, home, failure]",music

And my stepmother was like in the movie 'Precious.' I couldn't handle it. So I said to myself, 'I don't have a mother. I don't need one. I'm going to let music be my mother.'","[myself, mother, brother]",music
19,Wassily Kandinsky,"With few exceptions, music has been for some centuries the art which has devoted itself not to the reproduction of natural phenomena, but rather to the expression of the artist's soul, in musical sound.","[art, soul, artist]",music
20,Sarah McLachlan,"I would love to make my music and be completely anonymous, but that doesn't work. You can't have success and be faceless.","[love, success, work]",music

22,Ronnie Barker,"Many old music hall fans were present at the funeral today of Fred 'Chuckles' Jenkins, Britain's oldest and unfunniest comedian. In tribute, the vicar read out one of Fred's jokes, and the congregation had two minutes silence.","[today, silence, present]",music
23,Patch Adams,"I first came to Russia because of the culture, literature and music... and my interest in the 19th-century revolutionary spirit of Herzen, Bakunin and Kropotkin.

24,Maya Angelou,"I find in my poetry and prose the rhythms and imagery of the best - I mean, when I'm at my best - of the good Southern black preachers.

25,Clint Eastwood,"If you ever go to a music session, you'll notice that the musicians can sit down and start playing right away, and everyone knows what to do.
