1,Peter Zumthor,"The first 10 years of my professional life had only to do with running away from my father. He was a wonderful cabinet-maker, and me being the eldest son, I had to take over his shop, his profession and so on and so on. I tried to escape by going to art school and then going on to industrial design and then interior design.","[life, art, father]",design
2,Cindy Gallop,I design my start-up ventures around my own personal beliefs and values.,"[values, personal, beliefs]",design
3,Neill Blomkamp,"There has to be the popcorn genre element, or I don't engage the same way. I like action and vehicle design and guns and computer graphics as much as I like allegory. It's a constant balancing game. I want audiences to be on this rollercoaster that fits the Hollywood mould, but I also want them to absorb my observations.","[action, game, want]",design
4,Henry Petroski,"It seems to be a law of design that for every advantage introduced through redesign, there is an accompanying unintended disadvantage.","[law, disadvantage, every]",design
5,Alan Cooper,"There's a fundamental problem with how the software business does things. We're asking people who are masters of hard-edged technology to design the soft, human side of software as well. As a result, they make products that are really cool - if you happen to be a software engineer.","[technology, business, cool]",design
6,Millard Drexler,"I'm looking for best practices constantly. Apple has beautiful design, beautiful product, incredibly functional. But mostly it's about picking product, getting behind it, marketing it and introducing it to a customer. What they've done just inspires me.","[best, beautiful, looking]",design
7,Filippo Brunelleschi,"Many are ready, when listening to the inventor, to belittle and deny his achievements so that he will no longer be heard in honourable places, but after some months or a year, they use the inventor's words in speech or writing or design.","[writing, listening, words]",design
8,Ludwig Mies van der Rohe,A chair is a very difficult object. A skyscraper is almost easier. That is why Chippendale is famous.,"[difficult, chair, why]",design

11,Paul Rand,"Design is the method of putting form and content together. Design, just as art, has multiple definitions; there is no single definition. Design can be art. Design can be aesthetics. Design is so simple, that's why it is so complicated.","[art, together, simple]",design

13,Kenzo Tange,Designs of purely arbitrary nature cannot be expected to last long.,"[nature, long, expected]",design
14,John Maeda,I like stuff designed by dead people. The old designers. They always got it right because they didn't have to grow up with computers. All of the people that made the spoon and the dishes and the vacuum cleaner didn't have microprocessors and stuff. You could do a good design back then.,"[good, computers, people]",design
15,Ralph Lauren,"I went to my boss, and I said, 'Look, I'd like to design these ties because I think they could be new.' He said, 'The world isn't ready for Ralph Lauren.' I never forgot that because... I thought that was a compliment.","[boss, world, thought]",design
16,Kevin Systrom,"People interact with their phones very differently than they do with their PCs, and I think that when you design from the ground up with mobile in mind, you create a very different product than going the other way.","[mind, people, think]",design
17,Hedi Slimane,"I don't like the collusion between high fashion design and high street. You have to know where you stand. I belong to luxury fashion. That's what I've always felt and embraced. I like the best quality, the best fabrics and the most creative field in fashion. I will stay consistent. I belong to this world.","[best, quality, world]",design
18,D. H. Lawrence,"Design in art, is a recognition of the relation between various things, various elements in the creative flux. You can't invent a design. You recognize it, in the fourth dimension. That is, with your blood and your bones, as well as with your eyes.","[art, eyes, creative]",design
19,Robert Shea,"Ultimately we may still ask, why can't humans design a perfect society?","[society, perfect, may]",design

21,Mikhail Kalashnikov,I tried a dozen different modifications that were rejected. But they all served as a path to the final design.,"[path, tried, different]",design
22,Kanye West,"I thank Marc Jacobs so much for giving me the opportunity to design a shoe for Louis Vuitton, but the thing that broke my heart most was when they said, 'You're finished. The shoe's finished.'","[giving, opportunity, heart]",design
23,Steve Jobs,"In most people's vocabularies, design means veneer. It's interior decorating. It's the fabric of the curtains and the sofa. But to me, nothing could be further from the meaning of design.","[people, me, meaning]",design
24,Jamie Oliver,"If you only design menus that are essentially junk or fast food, the whole infrastructure supports junk.","[food, you, fast food]",design
