0,Katherine Parkinson,"I'm going to get myself one of those, um, movable computers - what do you call them... ? Laptops! I am bad. I still call my radio a wireless.","[myself, i am, you]",computers
1,Matt Frewer,I've always been slightly embittered about computers because it was the only subject I failed at school.,"[school, always, only]",computers
2,Jimmy Fallon,"My dad used to work at IBM, so we used to get discounts on computers and stuff, and I did have a ThinkPad.","[work, dad, used]",computers
3,Tony Fadell,"I had been doing MP3 players and handheld computers since 1990-1991, and so they sought me out because of my experience. And about 18 generations of iPod and three generations of iPhone later, I decided to leave Apple.","[experience, me, doing]",computers
4,Tony Fadell,"Computers are great tools, but they need to be applied to the physical world.","[great, world, tools]",computers
5,Martin Rees,"Some things, like the orbits of the planets, can be calculated far into the future. But that's atypical. In most contexts, there is a limit. Even the most fine-grained computation can only forecast British weather a few days ahead. There are limits to what can ever be learned about the future, however powerful computers become.","[future, weather, limits]",computers
6,Matt Mullenweg,"Everybody jokes about that old story about the world only needing five computers, but when you think about it, that's where we're heading.","[world, story, think]",computers
7,Harbhajan Singh,"I am not a great fan of computers. I do watch videos and analyse which batsman is playing how. Batsmen can play different shots on different days. A batsman may not play cover drives well, but if he connects with two such shots, he starts playing the drive well on that day.","[great, day, i am]",computers
8,E. L. Doctorow,"I started on computers with 'Billy Bathgate,' a little orange screen with black letters. I thought it was really cool, but it actually slowed me up for a while because it's so easy to revise, I tended to stay on the same page. I've learned to discipline myself.","[myself, cool, discipline]",computers
9,Scott Michael Foster,"I remember having computers at my parents' house growing up. We had different desktop PCs, but my first laptop was an IBM ThinkPad laptop. It was big, bulky, slow and terrible.","[parents, growing up]",computers
10,Eric Bristow,"I'm not on Twitter or Facebook and don't even use email. I don't trust computers: one day they'll all break down, and everyone will be knackered.","[trust, day, down]",computers
11,Whitfield Diffie,I thought of computers as very low class. I thought of myself as a pure mathematician and was interested in partial differential equations and topology and things like that.,"[myself, thought, class]",computers
12,Alvin Toffler,The next major explosion is going to be when genetics and computers come together. I'm talking about an organic computer - about biological substances that can function like a semiconductor.,"[science, together, talking]",computers
13,John Maeda,"Art shows us that human beings still matter in a world where money talks the loudest, where computers know everything about us, and where robots fabricate our next meal and also our ride there.","[art, money, world]",computers
14,Ann McLane Kuster,"Go into the auto mechanic, you've got to know computers to be able to work on the cars.","[work, know, you]",computers
15,Rick Boucher,"I actually use a computer a lot. I have three computers that I use on a regular basis - one is on my desk top in my Washington office, another is at home, and I have my laptop that I use when I'm travelling.","[home, office, three]",computers
16,Richard Dawkins,"Personally, I rather look forward to a computer program winning the world chess championship. Humanity needs a lesson in humility.","[winning, humanity, world]",computers
17,Richard Dawkins,"The reason we personify things like cars and computers is that just as monkeys live in an arboreal world and moles live in an underground world and water striders live in a surface tension-dominated flatland, we live in a social world.","[water, world, live]",computers
18,Steve Jobs,"We're going to be able to ask our computers to monitor things for us, and when certain conditions happen, are triggered, the computers will take certain actions and inform us after the fact.","[happen, ask, actions]",computers
19,Stephen Hawking,Computers double their performance every month.,"[performance, month, double]",computers
20,Joseph B. Wirthlin,Our computers have become windows through which we can gaze upon a world that is virtually without horizons or boundaries.,"[world, boundaries, windows]",computers
21,Kate Winslet,"I'm not very technically minded. I mean, I don't know how to do e-mail on computers.","[know, mean, how]",computers
22,Penn Jillette,"Computers absolutely changed my life. Before I had a computer, I had never written one thing. Not one thing. I'm a very bad speller and I was embarrassed by that. When I would type, the little mistakes would make me nutty, and I would never edit anything.","[life, mistakes, me]",computers
23,Penn Jillette,"My love of computers, besides being practical, is very direct and visceral. I love the way things look on the screen.","[love, look, way]",computers
24,Buzz Aldrin,Look at what Silicon Valley has done - the advance of computers.,"[look, done, advance]",computers
