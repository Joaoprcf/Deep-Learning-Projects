1,Thomas Marshburn,"The blackness of space was a big shock to me. It is a deep, three-dimensional, oily blackness. You can feel the distance.","[deep, me, you]",space
2,Andy Cohen,"I work out at Will Space four times a week. It's a private training gym. It's owned by my trainer, Will Torres. I just came from there, actually. I turned Mark Consuelos onto Will, so he goes there too. Today we boxed. It's every kind of cross-training you can do.","[work, today, training]",space
3,Carrie Preston,"Back in 2004, Kellie Overbey handed me her play 'Girl Talk' to read. I fell in love with her brutally delicious humor and the fearlessly deft way in which she drew her characters.

4,Peter Diamandis,"In 1980, during my sophomore year at MIT, I realized that the school didn't have a student space organization. I made posters for a group I called Students for the Exploration and Development of Space and put them up all over campus. Thirty-five people showed up. It was the first thing I ever organized, and it took off!","[school, people, year]",space
5,Brit Marling,"Here's the thing that I think about life - if you manage to get into a space where you don't need that much, where the overhead of your life is not that great and you're pretty happy and relaxed without that much stuff, you are really liberated because you never have to say yes to something because you want another refrigerator or car!","[life, happy, great]",space

8,Bruno Tonioli,"I always sleep on my own. I can't sleep with somebody else. Always separate bedrooms, bathrooms and closets. I'm very individual and I want my own space.","[sleep, want, individual]",space
9,Susan Orlean,"I might have missed my calling as an editor. In the spring, the sight of my empty garden beds gives me the horticultural equivalent of writers' block: So much space! So many plants to choose among, and yet none of them seem quite right!","[me, spring, choose]",space

11,Julia Leigh,"The point is the 'me' that you see before you is not the 'me' in my private little space, shape-shifting into the writing role, nor is it the 'me' that works with the actors. Here, at the end of the film doing interviews, I feel like I'm in disguise.","[end, writing, me]",space
12,Anna Deavere Smith,"What my work is, is my approach to it. It's the practice. And my work is about the effort that I make to get there. And I think if there's anything artistic, it's in that middle space.","[work, effort, practice]",space

15,Terrence J,"In the acting world, you can really only become good by practicing and doing it, and I just think every time you walk onto a set you just become better and better. I think I'm in a totally different space than I was back then on that first movie set.","[time, good, world]",space

18,Burt Rutan,"To allow public access to orbit, we would need breakthroughs that would lower the cost by a lot more than an order of magnitude and increase safety by a factor of 100 as compared to every launch system used since the first manned space flight. I think airborne launch will be a significant part of the safety solution.","[safety, think, solution]",space
19,Sharon Salzberg,"In our usual mind state, we are continually activating the process that in Buddhist terminology is known as 'bhava,' which literally means 'becoming.'

20,Tom Hodgkinson,"It takes a while to master the art of hammock-lounging. At first I could only manage five minutes or so before I thought I ought to get out and go and help a child learn how to swim or something.

24,Rachel Kushner,"L.A. is a great place to write because you have a lot of space. I have a big office at home, I can leave the doors open. Flowers bloom all year. But it's unglamorous in all the right ways.","[home, great, flowers]",space
25,Tim Armstrong,"Until the company believes in itself, AOL didn't have its own space and identity in the marketplace.
