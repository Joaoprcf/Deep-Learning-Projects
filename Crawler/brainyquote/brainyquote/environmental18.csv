0,Jeremy Grantham,I find the parallels between how some investors refuse to recognise the trends and our reaction to some of our environmental challenges very powerful. There is an unwillingness to process unpleasant data.,"[challenges, find, powerful]",environmental
1,Ramez Naam,"On almost every environmental issue I care about, in fact, I've been wrong at one point or another. I used to think that climate change was no big deal, that most environmental problems were massive exaggerations, that oil reserves were effectively unlimited, and more.","[change, climate change]",environmental
2,Ramez Naam,"Threats that could wipe out the bulk of life on earth abound.

6,David Frum,"I'm a latecomer to the environmental issue, which for years seemed to me like an excuse for more government regulation. But I can see that in rich societies, voters are paying less attention to economic issues and more to issues of the spirit, including the environment.","[government, environment, me]",environmental
7,Chellie Pingree,"Incredibly, oil and gas companies don't have to pay certain environmental costs that amount to small change to them, while an offshore wind project start-up is faced with fees that could mean the difference between building a wind farm and packing up and going home.","[change, home, small]",environmental
8,Stephen Fincher,"You name it - it is something every day from the Environmental Protection Agency, and every group I talk to is the same message: 'Please stop them. Please stop.'","[day, group, name]",environmental

10,David R. Brower,There is no place where we can safely store worn-out reactors or their garbage. No place!,"[place, garbage, where]",environmental
11,David R. Brower,"It seems that every time mankind is given a lot of energy, we go out and wreck something with it.","[time, energy, something]",environmental
12,Stewart Udall,Lady Bird Johnson did more than plant flowers in public places. She served the country superbly by planting environmental values in the minds of the nation's leaders and citizens.,"[flowers, bird, she]",environmental
13,Stewart Udall,"The environmental effects of the automobile are well known: motor vehicles cause, for example, as much as 75 percent of the noise and 80 percent of the air pollution in our cities, and the industry must face mounting pressure from environmentalists.","[pollution, face, pressure]",environmental
14,Chen Guangbiao,I don't know anything about propaganda for Chinese reunification. I only know about charity and environmental work. I just want to do good.,"[work, good, charity]",environmental

16,Sheherazade Goldsmith,The planet's environmental woes tend to be overlooked as we scramble for the latest high-tech gizmos - and conveniently ignore their energy consumption.,"[energy, ignore, planet]",environmental
17,Tristram Stuart,"Vegetarians have been around for a very long time - Pythagoreans forbade eating animals more than 2,500 years ago - but even as the environmental evidence mounted, they didn't appear to be winning the argument.","[time, winning, animals]",environmental
18,Tristram Stuart,"It is all very well for 2% of the population to live in a monastic state of meatlessness while everyone else gorges their way towards environmental meltdown or the nearest heart clinic. Vegetarianism is good for the willing minority, but not much use as a campaign tool.","[good, heart, live]",environmental
19,Tristram Stuart,Determining the value of individual texts has been an ideological scuffle in literary criticism for centuries: but the environmental cost of printing them hauls this dispute from the ivory tower into day-to-day decision-making. Is it right to write? The publishing industry is slowly beginning to commit to using sustainably harvested trees.,"[beginning, value, trees]",environmental
20,Tristram Stuart,"The manufacture and running of all the world's computers, the toxicity of the hardware mountains that we currently dump on other countries; all this can be totted up on the environmental account of web-users and its authors.","[mountains, computers, world]",environmental
21,Tristram Stuart,"Viewed from a holistic ecological perspective, some meat - such as conscientiously hunted animals - involves less suffering and environmental damage than arable agriculture, while both of these are significantly less harmful than indiscriminately purchasing meat on the market.","[suffering, perspective]",environmental
22,Fred Upton,"Our work on light bulbs wasn't an arbitrary mandate. We didn't just pick a standard out of the air, or look for a catchy sounding standard like 25 by 2025 not based in science or feasibility. Instead, we worked with both industry and environmental groups to come up with a standard that made sense and was doable.","[work, light, science]",environmental
23,Fred Upton,"Without international participation, jobs and emissions will simply shift overseas to countries that require few, if any, environmental protections, harming the global environment as well as the U.S. economy.","[environment, participation]",environmental
