8,Regina Spektor,"I've been thinking a lot about space. It was one of those slow-motion realisations how little we are, how far we are from everything else in our solar system. This idea of distance started kind of haunting me. How do you go forth and accomplish things but not end up leaving everything you started out with in the dust?","[end, thinking, me]",space
9,Neil deGrasse Tyson,"Whether or not people go into space or serve the space industry, they will have the sensitivity to those fields necessary to stimulate unending innovation in the technological fields, and it's that innovation in the 21st century that will drive tomorrow's economies.","[innovation, tomorrow, people]",space

13,Eugene Cernan,"I do believe there is life in outer space. Mathematically, there has to be, and if you believe as I do that there is a creator of the universe, then how can we be so arrogant to believe he created life here and nowhere else?","[life, believe, universe]",space
14,Martin Rees,"Maybe the search for life shouldn't restrict attention to planets like Earth.

16,James Surowiecki,"Technology is supposed to make our lives easier, allowing us to do things more quickly and efficiently. But too often it seems to make things harder, leaving us with fifty-button remote controls, digital cameras with hundreds of mysterious features and book-length manuals, and cars with dashboard systems worthy of the space shuttle.","[technology, leaving, digital]",space
17,Simon Sinek,"Starbucks was founded around the experience and the environment of their stores. Starbucks was about a space with comfortable chairs, lots of power outlets, tables and desks at which we could work and the option to spend as much time in their stores as we wanted without any pressure to buy. The coffee was incidental.","[work, time, experience]",space
18,David Duchovny,"I love the ocean, wide-open space and trees, but I'm not a gardener or anything like that. I think I may be, eventually.

23,Jon Meacham,"If heaven is understood more as God's space on earth than as an ethereal region apart from the essential reality we know, then what happens on earth matters even more than we think, for the Christian life becomes a continuation of the unfolding work of Jesus, who will one day return to set the world to rights.","[life, work, god]",space
24,William P. Young,"Part of my journey is to say that the soul of the human being must be a massively intricate, wonderful creation that God has a respect for in ways that we do not and that leaves a huge amount of space to go explore.","[respect, journey, god]",space
25,Chad Harbach,"I feel like every time I start up, it's like a truck you have to get into 15th gear, so you very solely crank into that mental space where you feel really immersed in the world of the book and then you can just kind of go. But there's just that few days of frustration to get to that point.","[time, book, world]",space
