3,Thich Nhat Hanh,"We fear that this moment will end, that we won't get what we need, that we will lose what we love, or that we will not be safe.

9,Tullian Tchividjian,"The world tells us in a thousand different ways that the bigger we become, the freer we will be.

I mean, try to construct a worldview out of that.","[thankful, religion]",happiness
