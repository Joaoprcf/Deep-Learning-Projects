0,Cynthia Ozick,"I don't agree with the sentiment 'write what you know.'... I think one should write what one doesn't know. The world is bigger and wider and more complex than our small subjective selves. One should prod, goad the imagination.","[small, world, know]",imagination

4,Anthony Browne,"Picture books are for everybody at any age, not books to be left behind as we grow older.

8,Vince Vaughn,"My approach as an actor has always been the same, in that the greatest gift that you're ever going to have is your imagination because you're not going to have all life experiences. So you draw on things that are sort of close to it but you spend your time expanding on it or drawing something specific on whatever your situation is.","[life, time, greatest]",imagination

11,Gary Weiss,"Humiliating events have a way of capturing the public's imagination. So it has been since antiquity, when gladiators were pitted against each other and the legions of Spartacus were crucified in endless rows on the way to Rome.","[rome, way, events]",imagination
12,Daniel H. Wilson,"Sometimes a technology is so awe-inspiring that the imagination runs away with it - often far, far away from reality. Robots are like that.

13,Paul Wolfowitz,"Someone once said that history has more imagination than all the scenario writers in the Pentagon, and we have a lot of scenario writers here. No one ever wrote a scenario for commercial airliners crashing into the World Trade Center.","[history, world, someone]",imagination

16,Pat Conroy,"I became a novelist because of 'Gone With the Wind,' or more precisely, my mother raised me up to be a 'Southern' novelist, with a strong emphasis on the word 'Southern' because 'Gone With the Wind' set my mother's imagination ablaze when she was a young girl growing up in Atlanta.","[mother, strong, girl]",imagination
17,Henry James,The face of nature and civilization in this our country is to a certain point a very sufficient literary field. But it will yield its secrets only to a really grasping imagination.

20,Tom Ellis,"To be in a show like 'Miranda' that captures everyone's imagination is amazing, but it's hard when people can't see beyond that.

23,Toby Jones,"They seem much rarer now, those auteur films that come out of a director's imagination and are elliptical and hermetic. All those films that got me into independent cinema when I was watching it seem thin on the ground.","[me, watching, cinema]",imagination
24,Noah Hawley,"The idea was always going to be that each year is a stand-alone story, which did make it easier on some level. It also requires the network to have the creative imagination to say, 'This is also 'Fargo,'' you know what I mean?","[creative, year, know]",imagination
25,Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie,"I ask questions. I watch the world. And what I have discovered is that the parts of my fiction that people most tell me are 'unbelievable' are those that are most closely based on the real, those least diluted by my imagination.","[world, people, me]",imagination
