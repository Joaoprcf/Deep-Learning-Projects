2,Anita Shreve,"WWI is a romantic war, in all senses of the word. An entire generation of men and women left the comforts of Edwardian life to travel bravely, and sometimes even jauntily, to almost certain death. At the very least, any story or novel about WWI is about innocence shattered in the face of experience.","[life, travel, death]",romantic
3,Luke Bracey,"With action movies, that's just fun stuff for me. That's me being a kid again. Same with 'The Best of Me' and these romantic dramas. It's such a freedom from reality and social constructions. You get to just have fun and play and be in a movie.","[best, freedom, fun]",romantic

7,Bill Pullman,"Truthfully, I almost avoided 'While You Were Sleeping,' because I find those romantic comedies kind of precious, and they're full of lines that leave you feeling a little bewildered when you say them.","[find, you, feeling]",romantic
8,Katharine Weymouth,"People assume that I came back to Washington because of the 'Post', but the truth is less romantic. I came back for a job.","[truth, job, people]",romantic
9,Zoe McLellan,"I want to do a romantic comedy. Like a 'When Harry Met Sally' romantic comedy... A really sweet, show-my-vulnerability kind of role.","[sweet, want, comedy]",romantic

11,Jason Fuchs,I'm a sucker for 'When Harry Met Sally' and all that romantic stuff.,"[sucker, sally, harry]",romantic

13,Virginia Henley,"I love to have real people of history interact with my fictional characters. History gives me the plot.

The heavier the history, the more romantic the couple must be.","[love, history, balance]",romantic
14,Suzanne Brockmann,"The lust and attraction are often a given in a romance novel - I want to dig into the elements of true friendship that form a foundation for a solid, gonna-last-forever romantic relationship.","[friendship, relationship]",romantic

19,Joshua Ferris,"The office is a romantic enabler because you're always around the person you have a crush on. There's no escape from, and maybe no desire to escape from, those pressure-cooker conditions. And there's an automatic series of things you have to talk about all the time.","[time, desire, escape]",romantic
20,Mathieu Amalric,There is the melancholy of Europe. There is the romantic malaise. Feeling sad is almost a form of deepness.,"[sad, feeling, europe]",romantic
21,Lori Wilde,"My husband is the romantic one in our relationship. He's always doing sweet things for me. Each year, we recreate our first date - it was a blind date, and we met at the zoo, followed by a trip to the museum.
