0,William Gibson,"A snappy label and a manifesto would have been two of the very last things on my own career want list. That label enabled mainstream science fiction to safely assimilate our dissident influence, such as it was. Cyberpunk could then be embraced and given prizes and patted on the head, and genre science fiction could continue unchanged.","[influence, career, want]",science
1,Lord Acton,"The science of politics is the one science that is deposited by the streams of history, like the grains of gold in the sand of a river; and the knowledge of the past, the record of truths revealed by experience, is eminently practical, as an instrument of action and a power that goes to making the future.","[knowledge, future, history]",science
2,Marissa Mayer,"When people think about computer science, they imagine people with pocket protectors and thick glasses who code all night.","[computers, night, people]",science
3,Paul Dirac,"In science one tries to tell people, in such a way as to be understood by everyone, something that no one ever knew before. But in poetry, it's the exact opposite.","[poetry, people, way]",science
4,Ferdinand de Saussure,"It is only since linguistics has become more aware of its object of study, i.e. perceives the whole extent of it, that it is evident that this science can make a contribution to a range of studies that will be of interest to almost anyone.","[study, contribution]",science
5,Carl Friedrich Gauss,The enchanting charms of this sublime science reveal only to those who have the courage to go deeply into it.,"[courage, go, reveal]",science
6,Octavia Butler,"What I'm working on now - I'm back to fantasy, although considering that it's me, I'm turning it into a kind of science fantasy. It's a vampire story - but my vampires are biological vampires. They didn't become vampires because someone bit them; they were born that way.","[me, someone, story]",science
7,Thomas Sowell,The march of science and technology does not imply growing intellectual complexity in the lives of most people. It often means the opposite.,"[technology, people]",science

9,Ray Bradbury,"Science fiction is any idea that occurs in the head and doesn't exist yet, but soon will, and will change everything for everybody, and nothing will ever be the same again. As soon as you have an idea that changes some small part of the world you are writing science fiction. It is always the art of the possible, never the impossible.","[change, art, writing]",science
10,Aravind Adiga,"In my family, as in most middle-class Indian families I knew when I was growing up, science and mathematics were held in awe.","[family, mathematics]",science
11,David Gerrold,"'Who are we?' And to me that's the essential question that's always been in science fiction. A lot of science fiction stories are - at their very best - evocations of that question. When we look up at the night sky and wonder, 'Is there anyone else out there?' we're also asking who we are we in relation to them.","[best, sky, night]",science
12,J. Michael Straczynski,"I've always been kind of a mutt creatively. I started off in journalism, and I've actually done more police and procedural shows than I've ever done science fiction shows. I was on 'Murder She Wrote,' I was on 'Walker, Texas Ranger,' I was on 'Jake and the Fat Man.'","[man, police, journalism]",science
13,Noam Chomsky,"I don't join the New Atheists. So, for example, I wouldn't have the arrogance to lecture some mother who hopes to see her dying child in Heaven - that's none of my business, ultimately. I won't lecture her on the philosophy of science.","[business, mother, philosophy]",science
14,Rainbow Rowell,"I like science fiction, I like fantasy, I like time travel, so I had this idea: What if you had a phone that could call into the past?","[travel, time, past]",science
15,Douglas Adams,"Wandering around the web is like living in a world in which every doorway is actually one of those science fiction devices which deposit you in a completely different part of the world when you walk through them. In fact, it isn't like it, it is it.","[world, living, walk]",science
16,Ada Lovelace,"Imagination is the Discovering Faculty, pre-eminently. It is that which penetrates into the unseen worlds around us, the worlds of Science.","[imagination, us, which]",science

21,Josef Albers,"It is not so for art in appreciation because art is concerned with human behavior. And science is concerned with the behavior of metal or energy. It depends on what the fashion is. Now today it's energy. It's the same soul behind it. The same soul, you see.","[art, today, appreciation]",science
22,Whitfield Diffie,We in science are spoiled by the success of mathematics. Mathematics is the study of problems so simple that they have good solutions.,"[success, good, mathematics]",science
23,Jeff Bezos,"Millions of people were inspired by the Apollo Program. I was five years old when I watched Apollo 11 unfold on television, and without any doubt it was a big contributor to my passions for science, engineering, and exploration.","[engineering, people, doubt]",science
24,George Washington,"There is nothing which can better deserve your patronage, than the promotion of science and literature. Knowledge is in every country the surest basis of public happiness.","[happiness, knowledge]",science
25,James Balog,"Climate change is real. Climate change is being substantially increased by humans and the carbon we put into the atmosphere. And it appears to be speeding up. If science has made any mistakes, science has been underestimating it.","[change, mistakes]",science
