0,Brandon Lee,"I've done my work and I'm happy with it... I respect my father very much, but I'm a very different person than he was.","[work, father, happy]",respect
1,Scott Wilson,"I'm not a great hunter. But I have fired guns in the past, when I was growing up. But it was part of growing up where I lived. You go out hunting or target practice. They also taught you to respect guns.","[great, past, growing up]",respect
2,Ellen Greene,"I'm proud of myself, people love me and respect me, and I like me. I like who I am.","[love, myself, i am]",respect
3,Josh Hamilton,The history of horror movies goes back a long way... of people trying to convincingly be terrified when looking at a piece of tape on the side of the camera box. I have a whole new respect for it.,"[history, people, looking]",respect
4,Hope Solo,"As women professional athletes, you have to have respect for every player and individual. Beyond that, it doesn't matter what your interests are. People can have their own lives.","[women, people, matter]",respect
5,Bonnie McKee,"I like to think of myself as the people's pop star a little bit. I respect Lady Gaga so much, and I love what she does, but she has this kind of mysterious, out-of-reach thing. I'm just not that - as much as I'd love to have that sort of mystique, I think I'm kind of an open book.","[love, myself, book]",respect
6,Riz Ahmed,"I think that with piracy and tighter funds being around, people are realising that the game to play is to try and win people's respect with bold film making and then win a special place in people's collections, rather than just having the biggest opening weekends.","[people, game, win]",respect
7,Scottie Thompson,"I don't really go out and do too much like networking and Hollywood events kind of thing. But I do some writing, and I find it helps me as an actor in terms of giving yourself back the power and feeling a bit of strength in that respect.","[strength, power, giving]",respect
8,Herschel Walker,"I started ballet in my early 20s. I studied for about ten years. Ballet is probably the one of the hardest things I've done, almost like MMA. People don't give it a lot of credit and think it's easy, but it's very difficult. For an athlete, you use muscles you really don't use, and ballet is something I really respect.","[people, easy, athlete]",respect
9,Cecile de France,"The most beautiful gift I have received in my life is the trust of Clint Eastwood. When you have this respect and this kind of responsibility on your shoulders, of course you bring the best of yourself.","[life, best, trust]",respect
10,Boman Irani,"I like the cold; I don't have problem with cold, and I don't have problem with rain either, as long as people are smiling. You know, early in my career, I used to wonder about this fan frenzy, but now I realize that there is genuine love, respect and affection, which makes me very proud to be an actor.","[love, rain, people]",respect
11,Padmasree Warrior,"I think the adoption rate with respect to social media and how companies leverage that varies by the company. Cisco is probably a leader in the space. A lot of times, we actually use virtual ways to communicate our brand and do some of our advertising, first on the social space, then we do on physical advertising.","[social media, leader, media]",respect
12,Bruce Sutter,"I'm certainly thankful for what the Cubs did for me. I respect their organization. It's the same way with the Atlanta Braves, an awfully fine organization. I respect everybody who's down there, and that's still where I live today. But the Cardinals represent the best years of my career.","[best, thankful, today]",respect
13,Judith Martin,"I am a traditionalist, and I'm an innovator. Most of what I do is to weigh change and legislate to the best of my ability on what should change and what should not. Do I have a respect for tradition? Of course I do. Do I have a blind belief in it? No.","[change, best, i am]",respect
14,James Franco,"In the end, I do have a group of friends and teachers whose opinions I respect, and so I guess I just have to be content with their feedback.","[end, friends, opinions]",respect
15,David Duchovny,"Privacy is something I have come to respect. I think when I was younger I wanted to tell everybody everything, because I thought I was so damn interesting. Then I heard the snoring.","[privacy, thought, think]",respect
16,Tom Stoppard,"I don't think writers are sacred, but words are. They deserve respect. If you get the right ones in the right order, you can nudge the world a little or make a poem which children will speak for you when you're dead.","[children, world, words]",respect
17,Gabriela Isler,"As a queen, I speak about unity and respect. I think that is the most important thing.","[unity, queen, speak]",respect
18,Don Lemon,I think it would be great if everybody could be out. But it's such a personal choice. People have to do it at their own speed. I respect that.,"[great, people, choice]",respect
19,Paul Watson,"Sometimes we are separated by differences, and sometimes we are united by common ideals of respect and compassion.","[compassion, differences]",respect
20,Akio Toyoda,"With respect to sticking accelerator pedals, we failed to connect the dots between problems in Europe and problems in the United States because the European situation related primarily to right-hand-drive vehicles. Toyota will increase its outreach to government agencies charged with protecting the safety of motorists and passengers.","[safety, government, problems]",respect
21,Drew Goddard,"As a filmmaker, I wish we didn't have to do trailers at all, quite honestly. I wish we didn't have to do posters. I wish didn't have to give anything away. I wish people could just come in the movie blind. But as an audience member, I respect that you have to tell an audience that this is worth your time.","[time, people, blind]",respect
22,Mary-Kate Olsen,"I'm definitely bicoastal, but I have to say, it's easier to live in New York than in L.A. I feel like people respect other people's space a bit more here. Everyone has the right to that freedom, right? Everyone has that right. It's freezing in New York right now. In L.A., it's sunny. But I would choose freezing over being followed.","[freedom, people, space]",respect
23,Richard Engel,We're all bloggers and punks and rebels with cameras. There is absolutely no respect for career journalists anymore.,"[career, no respect]",respect
24,James Avery,"See, the thing that bothers me with young actors, young actors of color specifically, is that they see movies and television, and they figure that's all it is to it. They have no respect for the craft. They want to be, you know, movie stars or whatever. And I worry that we're losing a certain quality, you know?","[stars, quality, losing]",respect
25,Ford Frick,"Take pride in your work at all times. Remember, respect for an umpire is created off the field as well as on.","[work, pride, remember]",respect
