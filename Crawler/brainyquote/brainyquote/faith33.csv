0,Karen Armstrong,"Today we often think that before we start living a religious life we have first to accept the creedal doctrines and that before one can have any comprehension of the loyalty and trust of faith, one must first force one's mind to accept a host of incomprehensible doctrines. But this is to put the cart before the horse.","[life, trust, loyalty]",faith
1,Eliot Spitzer,"As someone with a deep faith in competition and the market, I also know that markets only work with tough enforcement of the rules that guarantee competition and fair play - and that the pressure to break those rules only gets stronger as the amount of money involved gets larger.","[work, money, deep]",faith
2,Jonathan Sacks,"The faith religious believers have in God is small compared to the faith people put in politicians, knowing how many times they have been disappointed in the past but still insisting that this time it will be different.","[time, god, past]",faith
3,Yulia Tymoshenko,"I ask you, people who care about the soul of Ukraine, those who want to preserve the heart, the spirit and the faith of our country for future generations, to please defend it.","[future, heart, soul]",faith
4,Patrick Wilson,There are a lot of Christian fundamentalists; there are a lot of Muslim extremists. Every religion - Mormonism - has something way on the side that's completely using the religion as some weird backbone for their twisted faith. It has nothing to do with their religion.,"[religion, christian, nothing]",faith
5,Ioan Gruffudd,I've been brought up with the Christian faith with my family.,"[family, christian]",faith
6,Terry Eagleton,"The conversion of agnostic High Tories to the Anglican church is always rather suspect. It seems too pat and predictable, too clearly a matter of politics rather than faith.","[politics, church, matter]",faith
7,Angus T. Jones,What I would say to a person who is firm in their faith and wants to go into an acting career: It is such a difficult thing to do without compromising your beliefs.,"[career, difficult, acting]",faith
8,Rupert Sheldrake,"For more than 200 years, materialists have promised that science will eventually explain everything in terms of physics and chemistry. Believers are sustained by the faith that scientific discoveries will justify their beliefs.","[science, beliefs, chemistry]",faith
9,Gene Robinson,"Faith is a dynamic and ever-changing process, not some fixed body of truth that exists outside our world and our understanding. God's truth may be fixed and unchanging, but our comprehension of that truth will always be partial and flawed at best.","[best, god, truth]",faith
10,Mario Gabelli,How can you allow the trading companies to locate computers closer to exchanges and flash millions of bids to give an unfair advantage?... Even professionals are losing faith in some aspects of the system.,"[losing, computers, you]",faith
11,Philip Yancey,"In China, where you can be arrested and imprisoned for your faith, getting together with other Christians is a lifeline and you'll risk anything for the privilege. No one attends church in China casually, or for a social advantage - quite the opposite.","[together, risk, church]",faith
12,Sharon Salzberg,I think we spend so much of our lives trying to pretend that we know what's going to happen next. In fact we don't. To recognize that we don't know even what will happen this afternoon and yet having the courage to move forward - that's one meaning of faith.,"[courage, trying, meaning]",faith
13,Randa Abdel-Fattah,"My family are observant Muslims, but I've come to the faith through an intellectual conviction, and that's something that they've taught me. It's never been forced upon me. They've given me a very strong identity as an Australian Muslim.","[family, strong, identity]",faith
14,Miroslav Volf,Faith idles when character shrivels.,[character],faith
15,Miroslav Volf,"For Christians, faith is a precious good, the most valuable personal and social resource. When it is left untapped, the common good suffers - not just the particular interests of Christians.","[good, personal, precious]",faith
16,Vincent Nichols,"In many ways, the young are more religiously minded than the older generations. I think it's the flip side of an age of individualism. Youngsters are not afraid to tell you what they think, to express their faith and be quite exuberant about it.","[age, young, think]",faith
17,Lucy Larcom,"To different minds, poetry may present different phases. To me, the reverent faith of the people I lived among, and their faithful everyday living, was poetry; blossoms and trees and blue shies were poetry. God himself was poetry.","[god, poetry, people]",faith
18,Ellen G. White,"Ministers should be Bible students. They should thoroughly furnish themselves with the evidences of our faith and hope, and then, with full control of the voice and their feelings, present these evidences in such a manner that the people can calmly weigh them, and decide upon the evidences presented.","[hope, people, voice]",faith
19,Ellen G. White,"Confound not faith and feeling together. They are distinct. Faith is ours to exercise. Believe, believe. Let your faith take hold of the blessing, and it is yours by faith. Your feelings have nothing to do with this faith.","[together, believe, exercise]",faith
20,Patty Griffin,"I'm confused that there is a lack of faith in listening to and deciding what is a great song and instead going for these formulaic, bad songs over and over again. But that's what happened when people from beverage companies bought record labels and radio stations as opposed to people who love music owning record labels.","[love, music, great]",faith
21,Gordon B. Hinckley,"When all is said and done, the greatest satisfaction you'll have in this life as you grow old will be seeing your children grow in righteousness and faith and goodness as citizens of the society of which they are a part.","[life, children, greatest]",faith
22,Henry Selick,"I have more faith in doing something creative for a cable station or something like Yahoo or Google or Amazon. What Netflix did with 'House of Cards' and David Fincher was brilliant. That is inspiring to me. I think there is more chance for creativity in animation, it just hasn't happened there yet.","[creativity, creative, me]",faith
23,Jermain Defoe,"I had to tell Dad, 'It will be okay and be positive; keep praying and have faith'. I have always known about cancer, but to be around someone who has it and to see what it does in such a short space of time was hard. It makes you think about your life, about what is important.","[life, positive, time]",faith
24,Alfonso Cuaron,"I think it is something that is so important, to be very aware of the direction in which the 21st century is going with all this blind faith in democracy. And by the way, I am not against democracy - I am against the blind faith that is being put in democracy.","[democracy, i am, blind]",faith
25,Andrea Bocelli,Faith has a role to play in life. It is not related to success. It is the other way round. Success is related to faith. Faith comes first.,"[life, success, way]",faith
