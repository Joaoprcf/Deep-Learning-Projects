10,Anne-Marie Duff,"I didn't have a teen age at all. I didn't even look at boys, never mind... then suddenly it was like, 'Oh my god!' So I made up for a lot of lost time very quickly.

18,John Hughes,"At the time I came along, Hollywood's idea of teen movies meant there had to be a lot of nudity, usually involving boys in pursuit of sex, and pretty gross overall.

23,Christopher McCulloch,"I think the feeling was that 'Venture Brothers' really has something to sell in terms of a feature. 'Aqua Teen' is an element minute cartoon, and its very subversive and non sequitur and weird.

24,Anna Wintour,"I like having young assistants in my office; they have energy, and I spend time with them to make sure they understand what we're doing.
