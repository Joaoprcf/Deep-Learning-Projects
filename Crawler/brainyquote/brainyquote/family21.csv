0,Bob Ehrlich,Some of the most important conversations I've ever had occurred at my family's dinner table.,"[dinner, important]",family
1,Maureen O'Hara,I was born into the most remarkable and eccentric family I could possibly have hoped for.,"[born, most, eccentric]",family
2,Anthony Anderson,"I realized my family was funny, because nobody ever wanted to leave our house.","[funny, nobody, leave]",family
3,Marcus Samuelsson,"I love Thanksgiving because it's a holiday that is centered around food and family, two things that are of utmost importance to me.","[love, holiday, food]",family
4,Jess Glynne,"I keep my head straight by having the right people around me, from my friends and family to my management and my team. They all keep me in my place. If I didn't have them supporting all the work that I do, I wouldn't be in such a solid place.","[work, team]",family
5,Michael Jackson,I love my family very much. I wish I could see them a little more often than I do. But we understand because we're a show business family and we all work.,"[love, work, business]",family
6,Toni Morrison,"I don't think a female running a house is a problem, a broken family. It's perceived as one because of the notion that a head is a man.","[man, problem, broken]",family
7,Izabel Goulart,Diabetes is a disease that's had a deep impact on my family. My little brother has had type 1 diabetes since he was a baby and I have spent time learning about the disease and trying to bring attention to it so that one day soon we will reach a cure.,"[time, learning, deep]",family
8,Rita Levi-Montalcini,"The four of us enjoyed a most wonderful family atmosphere filled with love and reciprocal devotion. Both parents were highly cultured and instilled in us their high appreciation of intellectual pursuit. It was, however, a typical Victorian style of life, all decisions being taken by the head of the family, the husband and father.","[life, love, father]",family
9,Marina Abramovic,"People ask why there are so few female artists who succeed. It's because women are not ready to sacrifice as much as men. Women want a man, they want a family, they want to have children, they want to be loved, and to be an artist. And they can't; it's impossible.","[women, children, man]",family
10,Wole Soyinka,"One's own self-worth is tied to the worth of the community to which one belongs, which is intimately connected to humanity in general. What happens in Darfur becomes an assault on my own community, and on me as an individual. That's what the human family is all about.","[community, humanity, me]",family
11,Christopher Lasch,It is the logic of consumerism that undermines the values of loyalty and permanence and promotes a different set of values that is destructive of family life.,"[life, loyalty, logic]",family
12,Kerry Washington,"The breakdown of the black community, in order to maintain slavery, began with the breakdown of the black family. Men and women were not legally allowed to get married because you couldn't have that kind of love. It might get in the way of the economics of slavery. Your children could be taken from you and literally sold down the river.","[love, women, children]",family
13,Mary-Kate Olsen,"I like change. I've never really had much consistency in my life, you know, from everyday work to my living situation to whether or not I'm going to be in L.A. The one constant thing in my life is my friends and family, which is all I need.","[life, change, work]",family
14,Jonathan Sacks,"Make space in your life for the things that matter, for family and friends, love and generosity, fun and joy. Without this, you will burn out in mid-career and wonder where your life went.","[life, love, joy]",family
15,NeNe Leakes,"Most of the time my own family feels like I don't need anything, I'm tough as nails and I don't have any feelings about anything. They really think that I'm this super tough person. I have a tough exterior, but I get upset. I have feelings and all those things. I wear my heart on my sleeve.","[time, heart, tough]",family
16,Gary Vaynerchuk,"Stop doing things that waste time. Don't replace time with your family or things that you need to do. I needed to put together two fantasy teams this weekend because that's something I enjoy, but I did stop playing Nintendo Wii for hours on end.","[time, together, end]",family
17,Poppy Delevingne,"It would be ridiculous for me to say I am unlucky, but, like any other family and any other girl, I've had my ups and downs.","[i am, girl, me]",family
18,Rachael MacFarlane,"I don't think that I could have survived in my family without a naughty sense of humor; yeah, absolutely. I think my brother and I both get our senses of humor from our parents. I mean, my mother was absolutely hilarious and foul. She had the most ridiculously off color sense of humor, so that was sort of what we grew up with.","[mother, humor, parents]",family
19,Amanda Borden,"Gymnastics demands so much of our time. We train all week and travel and compete on weekends. The people you're surrounded by really become your second family, your best friends, your sisters. My coach was like a second mother for me.","[best, travel, time]",family
20,Ann Robinson,The results of this survey are shocking and should be a wake-up call to men and women that drinking and smoking too much not only gives you a bad headache in the morning but can affect your ability to start a family.,"[morning, women, men]",family
21,Monica Bellucci,I'm a lucky person because I've been loved a lot. I have a great family.,"[great, loved, lucky]",family
22,Martha Griffiths,"Give us a chance to show you that those so-called protective laws to aid women - however well intentioned originally - have become in fact restraints, which keep wife, abandoned wife, and widow alike from supporting her family.","[women, wife, chance]",family
23,Joseph Joubert,Love and fear. Everything the father of a family says must inspire one or the other.,"[love, father, fear]",family
24,Walter Cronkite,"I think somebody ought to do a survey as to how many great, important men have quit to spend time with their families who spent any more time with their family.","[time, great, men]",family
25,Jerry Brown,"Automation and technology would be a great boon if it were creative, if there were more leisure, more opportunity to engage in raising a family, providing guidance to the young, all the stuff we say we need. America will work if we're all in it together. It'll work when there's a shared sense of destiny. It can be done!","[work, technology, great]",family
