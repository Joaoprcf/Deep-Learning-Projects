0,Brett Ratner,"People can criticise all day long, I think I've proven myself, I think I deliver. And I agree, box office does not mean a movie's good, but I feel like I'm making good movies and I'm delivering in box office.","[good, myself, day]",movies
1,Stephen Chbosky,"I found, through the process of doing 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower,' that I really love directing movies and I love writing books and so this will become the centerpiece of my career for the next ten or twenty years. Doing these adaptations.","[love, writing, career]",movies
2,Tony Kushner,"Making movies is a very different experience in a lot of ways. It's difficult when you're used to owning the copyright and having a landlord's possessory rights - I rent my plays to the companies that do them and, if I'm upset, I can pull the play. But the only two directors I've worked with are pretty great.","[experience, great, difficult]",movies
3,Jason Reitman,I'm not going to have a perfect career. It's better to be Billy Wilder and make lots of movies and have five or six great ones than to make so few movies that when you make a bad one it crushes you.,"[great, career, perfect]",movies
4,Jason Reitman,"Well, Toronto, I consider to be the birthplace of my films. I've made three films and this is the third one to premiere here in the same theater on the same day at the same time - they are my audience. They're the people that I think about while I'm writing, directing, and editing. I specifically make movies for them.","[time, day, writing]",movies
5,Ellen Page,I don't really want to do the Hollywood thing. I think you ought to try to say something with your movies.,"[want, think, try]",movies
6,Kevin McHale,"In San Paulo I went to the movies and by the time I left the theater there was a mob at the exit. I had never been in that kind of situation when we weren't on tour and there was a whole bunch of security. I'm a little dude, and out of nowhere to have 50 or 60 people come running towards me when I'm jut with my friend, it was kind of scary.","[time, security, people]",movies
7,Shawn Levy,"I just think that sports movies have such a built-in visceral, rooting interest, an epic win or lose redemptive quality. When they get it right, it can make for a really rousing movie experience.","[experience, sports, quality]",movies
8,Ginnifer Goodwin,"It's like, if you can't focus on a movie for 90 minutes without looking at your phone, then don't go to the movies! You've got some issues, so you should probably stay home and work on those issues, and not distract everyone with lights, and sounds, oh my gosh, the tapping on the screens, it makes me crazy!","[work, home, focus]",movies
9,Ginnifer Goodwin,"Sometimes I make very selfish choices; like I did 'Once Upon A Time' for my inner 8-year-old and my hypothetical future child. I've done some movies because I would regret them if I didn't, but other projects I've done because they've scared me or if I felt I needed to do a big romantic comedy to help me professionally.","[time, future, romantic]",movies
10,Jennifer Morrison,"For me, in general, it's always about the material. Obviously, it's about the material and hoping that someone wants to hire me for a job, too, but I've certainly seen films like 'Orphan' and movies like that where I know that if I had had the opportunity to read that script or had an opportunity to do it, I would have wanted to do it.","[opportunity, job, me]",movies
11,Marlon Wayans,"I'm the most inappropriate dad. I curse in front of my kids and their friends. I let my kids watch R-rated movies. I'll walk by the movie theater and say, 'Let's go see that,' and my kids will say, 'No, it's rated R. It's not appropriate for kids.' I'm like Uncle Dad. We have fun. I don't live with them, but I drive over four days a week.","[dad, week, fun]",movies
12,Anna Deavere Smith,"Movies, as evidenced by a chorus of protesting and celebrating Americans, influence broader trends.","[influence, trends]",movies
13,Rebecca Hall,"One of the great things about the 'Iron Man' franchise is that they employ fascinating actors who don't necessarily do action movies. Before 'Iron Man' you didn't associate Robert Downey, Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow with those kinds of films. There's an emphasis on repartee and wit.","[great, man, action]",movies
14,Joe Manganiello,"I was kind of a dark kid. I loved Halloween, and I loved vampires and the black and white old monster movies.","[black and white, black, dark]",movies
15,Seth Grahame-Smith,"Sometimes we see the Civil War in movies and imagine these neatly aligned rows of men with muskets, walking in line to shoot each other. In reality the things that fascinated me were how absolutely ruthless and violent so many engagements were, how much suffering and how men were not prepared.","[war, men, suffering]",movies
16,Alfred Molina,"I love the theatre. It's a perfect life for an actor: you can do a couple of movies and then go and do a play, and then go back and do another movie. It's a nice way to live your life.","[life, love, theatre]",movies
17,Cameron Crowe,"I have my problems with 'Singles'. To me, 'Singles' is the least successful of the movies I've been lucky enough to make.","[successful, me, problems]",movies
18,Lloyd Kaufman,"I don't make crappy movies. I spend two or three years making a film. I don't take myself seriously, but I take my movies very seriously.","[myself, seriously, film]",movies
19,Grant Morrison,"Write comic books if you love comic books so much that you want to write them. Don't write them like movies. Comics can do a lot of things that movies can't do, and vice versa.","[love, want, you]",movies
20,Sasha Pieterse,"When I watch movies or TV, I am like, 'Wow that guy is really cute, I really like him,' but I don't really have one person that I would die to go to something with. There are so many hot guys.","[i am, cute, die]",movies
21,Cristin Milioti,"I love movies, but I think people think relationships are supposed to go how they go in movies. The ones I like are the ones that represent life.","[life, love, people]",movies
22,Suzan-Lori Parks,"I love beautiful black-and-white movies - anything Bette Davis, especially 'Now', 'Voyager', 'Casablanca', 'Mildred Pierce'; anything by Orson Welles, Truffaut, or Godard; and 'Paper Moon' by Peter Bogdanovich.","[love, beautiful, moon]",movies
23,Tony D'Souza,"I once waited on Sean Connery. A long time ago. This was at the Caledonian Hotel in Edinburgh. They closed down the restaurant for him, and when he walked in with his morning paper, all the waitresses started squealing. He was a big guy, bigger than in the movies.","[time, morning, down]",movies
24,Hans Zimmer,You have to realize I like doing big movies that appear on a big screen. So the visuals and the audio have to be of a certain quality before I start to get excited about the thing.,"[quality, doing, start]",movies
25,Lena Headey,"For me, horror movies are a real escape.","[me, escape, real]",movies
