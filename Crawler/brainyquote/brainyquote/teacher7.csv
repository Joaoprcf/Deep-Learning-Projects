2,Rick Riordan,"I've been reading Greek mythology since I was a kid. I also taught it when I was a sixth grade teacher, so I knew a lot of mythological monsters already.

18,Charles Stanley,You can't tell a woman who is called by God to teach that she cannot teach the Word of God... So I think the distinction is that there's a difference between the authority of a pastor and a Bible teacher.,"[god, woman, bible]",teacher
19,Cory Monteith,"I was 20 years old, working as a roofer and a telemarketer and driving a taxi, just barely getting by. A friend of a friend suggested I try acting. I was like, 'Why?

21,John Mahoney,"I didn't want to be the archetypal sponging brother-in-law, so I didn't go into acting when I got to the States.
