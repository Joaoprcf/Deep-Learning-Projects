3,Arundhati Roy,"In a way, writing is an incredible act of individualism, producing your language, and yet to use it from the heart of a crowd as opposed to as an individual performance is a conflicting thing. I do stand alone, and yet it's not about being an individual or being ambitious.","[heart, language, writing]",alone

6,Joe Rogan,"I think that one of the reasons why people look towards the end of humanity is that people are afraid to die alone.

8,Maya Angelou,"Information helps you to see that you're not alone. That there's somebody in Mississippi and somebody in Tokyo who all have wept, who've all longed and lost, who've all been happy. So the library helps you to see, not only that you are not alone, but that you're not really any different from everyone else.","[happy, library, information]",alone

11,R. Kelly,I still feel like I'm alone at times - even if I'm in the midst of a million people. Because no one - including me - understands my mind creatively. I haven't really been formally introduced to my gift yet. I feel like I'm still on the runway.,"[gift, mind, people]",alone

14,Cate Blanchett,"There are very few issues that lie specifically in one region now. Polio in Syria doesn't affect Syria alone. I don't think any issue can ever be isolated into local politics these days, because we all know too much.","[politics, lie, know]",alone
