0,Sebastian Thrun,"I've developed my passion for cars that drive themselves from being stuck in traffic for many, many, many hours of my life. I don't know what it adds up to, but I feel like I've lost a year or two just in traffic. That's big to me. That's a lot of time, a lot of money that I just lose on the road.","[life, time, money]",car
1,Analeigh Tipton,I went to USC for writing. I was judgmental of actors and their Starbucks and fancy cars.,"[writing, starbucks, fancy]",car
2,A. S. Byatt,Cyclists. I really hate them. I wish they would not be so self-righteous and realise they are a danger to pedestrians. I wish cyclists would not vindictively snap off wing mirrors on cars when they were trying to cross in front of the car at a danger to motorists and pedestrians.,"[hate, trying, wish]",car
3,Simon Cowell,The only magazines I read are car magazines.,"[only, magazines, read]",car
4,Bill Bryson,"Book tours are really kind of fun. You get to stay in nice hotels, you are driven everywhere in big silver cars, you are treated as if you are much more important than you are, you can eat steak three times a day at someone else's expense, and you get to talk endlessly about yourself for weeks at a stretch.","[day, book, yourself]",car
5,Bibhu Mohapatra,My engineer dad is where my technical acumen comes from. I remember him taking me to the factories to see how what works. Often he used to open up his motorbike to fix things and I saw how the wheels worked. His car used to be open for dissection very regularly. All this taught me and inspired me to look beyond what I could see on the skin.,"[dad, me, remember]",car
6,Gabriel Iglesias,"The Ford Flex is a really, really cool car. You get inside and you have so much headroom and it's really comfortable to drive and it's real techy inside. You look at the screen and it's blue and you've got all kinds of controls. Everything is digital.","[cool, blue, look]",car
7,Bruce Forsyth,"My father earned every penny he had, and I would have loved to have bought him a Rolls-Royce because his whole life was cars. Sadly, he didn't live to see the day when I could have done that for him, which still hurts.","[life, father, day]",car
8,Julian Casablancas,"L.A.'s kind of, like, seven really cool towns. It's so laid-back. If you go in the right spot, you can walk around, and you don't need a car.","[cool, walk, you]",car
9,Trent Reznor,"If I go onstage, I want to give people everything they want and more. I'll wash their car for them on their way out.","[people, want, way]",car
10,Matt Dillon,"People get really nuts around cars. They get angry at cars, they get angry at their car, they get angry at people driving in cars; there's something really comical about that, about automobiles.","[people, angry, driving]",car
11,Daniel Bruhl,"I have one car that works; it's fast and safe: an Audi 5. And I have two old cars that never work: an old Peugeot convertible, and an Alfa Romeo Giulia.","[work, safe, two]",car
12,DMX,"When I was a kid, nobody in my family had a car. And I didn't have many toys. The only toys I had were the ones I would steal.","[family, nobody, toys]",car
13,Joyce Meyer,Things in themselves have no life in them. A car can't comfort or encourage you. A house means nothing if there's no life and love inside.,"[life, love, nothing]",car
14,Mia Sara,"I'm always in favor of more glamour. I embarrass my children, I think. I am the lady in feathers in the car pool line.","[children, i am, think]",car
15,Leland Orser,"My very first role was with James Earl Jones on 'Gabriel's Fire' on TV. He drove a Chevy Citation, which is the exact same car that I bought from a guy in San Francisco called Sandy Boone. I showed up on set, and James Earl Jones was driving the car I had bought from Sandy for $250.","[fire, driving, same]",car
16,Pamela Adlon,I went from buying my own condominium and a car for myself when I was 17 on 'The Facts of Life' to not being able to pay my rent. I was at the unemployment office all the time. I had to sell my record collection just to make ends meet. And then I started getting these voice-over jobs.,"[life, time, myself]",car
17,Tamer Hassan,"The worst thing people ever say is that 'I can't afford to have kids!' It's selfish, and what infuriates me is when people say they can't do stuff they like go on holidays and buy cars when they have kids. You can - you find the money, you've just got to work harder for it.","[work, holidays, money]",car
18,Bill Moseley,"My dad loved to 'arrange things' to take us kids to that scared the crap out of us on Halloween. He'd take us to the old 'Hermit's House' at the edge of town. He'd park the car 100 yards down the street and say, 'Go back there and get something off the front porch!'","[dad, loved, down]",car
19,Mark Haddon,"I am really interested in eccentric minds. It's rather like being fascinated by how cars work. It's really boring if your car works all the time. But as soon as something happens, you get the bonnet up. If someone has an abnormal or dysfunctional state of mind, you get the bonnet up.","[work, time, mind]",car
20,Ryan Gosling,It's not good just to have life experience of film-making and that's all. It's hard to play a real person when you've been in jets and town cars for three years.,"[life, experience, good]",car
21,Tim Allen,"My wife loves cars, but the difference is she doesn't have 20 years of understanding the background of them. She basically drives them and uses her gut feelings as to which is best.","[best, wife, she]",car
22,Michael Caine,"The greatest luxury is not driving. I didn't own a car until I was 30, and that was a Rolls-Royce, so it was cheaper to insure a chauffeur. I never want to drive again. My mind is always on other things. I hate parking, and I'm very short-tempered and would get road rage, I'm sure.","[greatest, mind, hate]",car
23,Grover Norquist,Everyone would have bigger and safer cars if they didn't have those CAFE standards: corporate average fuel economy.,"[economy, everyone, bigger]",car
24,Idina Menzel,"I think I hid my singing talent from a lot of my friends at school because I didn't want to alienate anyone. If everyone was singing along in the car to a Madonna song, I didn't join in because when we're younger we're afraid of sticking out or showing off, when in fact we should own those things that make us really unique.","[school, friends, unique]",car
25,Eddie Rickenbacker,"Long practise in driving a racing car at a hundred miles an hour or so gives first-class training in control and judging distances at high speed and helps tremendously in getting motor sense, which is rather the feel of your engine than the sound of it, a thing you get through your bones and nerves rather than simply your ears.","[training, control, racing]",car
