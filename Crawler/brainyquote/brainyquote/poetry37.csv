0,Robert Morgan,"I don't think American poetry has gotten any better in the past 35 years. Oddly enough, creative writing programs seem to have been good for fiction, and I would not have predicted that.","[good, past, writing]",poetry
1,Robert Morgan,"I love to compare different time frames. Poetry can evoke the time of the subject. By a very careful choice of words you can evoke an era, completely throw the poem into a different time scale.","[love, time, words]",poetry
2,Robert Morgan,"One of the most powerful devices of poetry is the use of distortions. You can go from talking about the way a minute passes to the way a century passes, or a lifetime.","[powerful, way, talking]",poetry
3,Robert Morgan,The fact that something is in a rhymed form or in blank verse will not make it good poetry.,"[good, something, blank]",poetry
4,Robert Morgan,"What actually makes poetry poetry is of course impossible to define. We recognize it when we hear it, when we see it, but we can't define it.","[impossible, see, hear]",poetry
5,Robert Morgan,"The idea of avant-garde art is a very suspicious thing to me, the idea that poetry is new and it keeps being new the way Chevrolets every year are new.","[art, year, me]",poetry
6,Robert Morgan,"I learned to impersonate the kind of person that talks about poetry. It comes from teaching, I think.","[think, kind, person]",poetry
7,Jose Marti,A grain of poetry suffices to season a century.,"[season, grain, century]",poetry
8,Ezra Pound,Music begins to atrophy when it departs too far from the dance... poetry begins to atrophy when it gets too far from music.,"[music, dance, begins]",poetry
9,Ezra Pound,"And New York is the most beautiful city in the world? It is not far from it. No urban night is like the night there... Squares after squares of flame, set up and cut into the aether. Here is our poetry, for we have pulled down the stars to our will.","[stars, beautiful, world]",poetry
10,Caroline Kennedy,Poetry is really a way of sharing feelings and ideas.,"[ideas, sharing, way]",poetry
11,Caroline Kennedy,"When you're going through something, whether it's a wonderful thing like having a child or a sad thing like losing somebody, you often feel like 'Oh my God, I'm so overwhelmed; I'm dealing with this huge thing on my own.' In fact, poetry's a nice reminder that, no, everybody goes through it. These are universal experiences.","[god, sad, losing]",poetry
12,Caroline Kennedy,"The biggest problem is people are afraid of poetry, think they can't understand it or that it will be boring.","[people, problem, think]",poetry
13,Caroline Kennedy,"I never thought I'd be doing poetry books. I never really studied poetry. But the first one I did was after my mother died, and I realized that people sort of think and talk about her style and fashion, but in fact, what made her the person she was was really her love of reading and ideas.","[love, mother, style]",poetry
14,James Fenton,"My feeling is that poetry will wither on the vine if you don't regularly come back to the simplest fundamentals of the poem: rhythm, rhyme, simple subjects - love, death, war.","[love, death, war]",poetry
15,James Fenton,"Lyric poetry is, of course, musical in origin. I do know that what happened to poetry in the twentieth century was that it began to be written for the page. When it's a question of typography, why not? Poets have done beautiful things with typography - Apollinaire's 'Calligrammes,' that sort of thing.","[beautiful, page, know]",poetry
16,James Fenton,"English poetry begins whenever we decide to say the modern English language begins, and it extends as far as we decide to say that the English language extends.","[language, english language]",poetry
17,James Fenton,"Some people think that English poetry begins with the Anglo-Saxons. I don't, because I can't accept that there is any continuity between the traditions of Anglo-Saxon poetry and those established in English poetry by the time of, say, Shakespeare. And anyway, Anglo-Saxon is a different language, which has to be learned.","[time, language, people]",poetry
18,James Fenton,"When we study Shakespeare on the page, for academic purposes, we may require all kinds of help. Generally, we read him in modern spelling and with modern punctuation, and with notes. But any poetry that is performed - from song lyric to tragic speech - must make its point, as it were, without reference back.","[help, speech, page]",poetry
19,James Fenton,"Poetry carries its history within it, and it is oral in origin. Its transmission was oral. Its transmission today is still in part oral, because we become acquainted with poetry through nursery rhymes, which we hear before we can read.","[history, today, within]",poetry
20,James Fenton,"Composers need words, but they do not necessarily need poetry. The Russian composer, Aleksandr Mossolov, who chose texts from newspaper small ads, had a good point to make. With revolutionary music, any text can be set to work.","[music, work, good]",poetry
21,James Fenton,"Modernism in other arts brought extreme difficulty. In poetry, the characteristic difficulty imported under the name of modernism was obscurity. But obscurity could just as easily be a quality of metrical as of free verse.","[quality, free, name]",poetry
22,James Fenton,"A glance at the history of European poetry is enough to inform us that rhyme itself is not indispensable. Latin poetry in the classical age had no use for it, and the kind of Latin poetry that does rhyme - as for instance the medieval 'Carmina Burana' - tends to be somewhat crude stuff in comparison with the classical verse that doesn't.","[history, age, kind]",poetry
23,James Fenton,Great poetry does not have to be technically intricate.,"[great, technically]",poetry
24,James Fenton,"Poetry carries its history within it, and it is oral in origin. Its transmission was oral.","[history, within, origin]",poetry
25,James Fenton,"The voice is raised, and that is where poetry begins. And even today, in the prolonged aftermath of modernism, in places where 'open form' or free verse is the orthodoxy, you will find a memory of that raising of the voice in the term 'heightened speech.'","[today, memory, voice]",poetry
