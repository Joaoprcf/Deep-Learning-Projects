0,Dennis Prager,"For some reason, the evolutionists have not come up with an evolution-based explanation for why human beings react so powerfully to music. But surely they will.","[reason, react, why]",music
1,Rob Zombie,"I'm not a big fan of the thought that you can become a star by winning a contest. I'm sort of old-fashioned. I think people need to get out there and they need to work and they need to do their music because they love it. If they become successful, then great, and if they are not, whatever.","[love, work, great]",music
2,Andre Rieu,"It is a real piece of art if you can make a waltz sound like it is the easiest piece of music to play, because it's really not.","[art, you, sound]",music
3,Angel Haze,I can't really even name a person I like in hip-hop music.,"[hip-hop, name, person]",music
4,Jennifer Hudson,"I like to have songs with me that have substance. That's missing from a lot of today's music. You might hear a song with a catchy beat, but what's it about? It's not empowering or helping anyone.","[today, me, song]",music
5,Robyn,"I think I'm always adopting a persona. That's how I look at pop music. I don't feel like I have to be myself. I feel like I have to be true to myself, but I don't have to show an exact picture of who I am.","[myself, i am, true]",music
6,Chadwick Boseman,"I love all types of music. Jazz, classical, blues, rock, hip-hop. I often write scripts to instrumentals like a hip-hop artist. Music inspires me to write. It's either music playing or completely silent. Sometimes distant sound fuels you. In New York there's always a buzzing beneath you.","[love, me, artist]",music
7,Jason Aldean,"Country music in the mid-'90s was a big influence on my career, and I played all the songs that are referenced in '94' back in my club days. Joe Diffie was rocking a sick mullet, and he was hotter than ever... just putting out monster hit after monster hit. It totally takes me back to those days, and it makes me smile every time I hear it.","[time, smile, influence]",music
8,Leah LaBelle,"I grew up seeing my parents perform and sing, and I just always wanted to be singing, too. Music has always been my deepest passion and what I felt most connected to.","[passion, parents, singing]",music
9,Tiesto,"Since I was a kid, I always felt the need to share the music I love with as many people as possible, and DJing seemed like the perfect outlet.","[love, people, perfect]",music
10,Neon Hitch,"I've never been able to relate to many people. I've always been the outcast child. I don't follow the rules. That's kind of how I do everything. Through my music, I've found a place in the world where I'm accepted, so I'm happy.","[happy, world, people]",music
11,Skrillex,"The people who I grew up making music with, we've all grown up and become successful in different ways. My manager supported me since I was 16 and believed in me as a musician. He's been there since Day 1, and there's so much to be said about doing something with people that you love.","[love, day, people]",music
12,Rufus Wainwright,"You know the question: 'How do you get to Carnegie Hall?' Answer: 'Practise?' Well, in my case, I got there by not practising. I didn't finish my music degree. And when I got into the pop world, I decided not to conform because I figured that the point of being an artist was that you shouldn't be like anyone else.","[world, finish, artist]",music
13,Noel Gallagher,"Gone are the days when Virgin Records was owned by Richard Branson, a fan of music. Now they're all owned by some guy who bought it off some guy who bought it off some guy who wants a return on his investment.","[investment, days, now]",music
14,Trent Reznor,"I think my music's more disturbing than Tupac's - or at least I thought some of the themes of 'The Downward Spiral' were more disturbing on a deeper level - you know, issues about suicide and hating yourself and God and people and everything else.","[god, yourself, suicide]",music
15,Trent Reznor,"My music, I hope, takes 100% of your concentration. I know how to do that.","[hope, know, concentration]",music
16,John Frusciante,"I consider my music to be Progressive Synth Pop, which says nothing about what it sounds like, but does describe my basic approach.","[nothing, progressive]",music
17,Laura Bell Bundy,"What I loved about country music when I was a kid was the Grand Ole Opry, was 'Hee Haw,' was 360 degrees of entertainment.","[loved, country]",music
18,Louis Tomlinson,"My favorite music isn't necessarily the songs that One Direction come out with. That doesn't mean to say I don't secretly really love some of our songs, which I do. My personal tastes... I actually like quite a bit acoustic and more mellow kinds of things.","[love, direction, personal]",music
19,Luke Bryan,"I want my music to jump off the stage and out of the speakers. When we do 'Rain Is A Good Thing' paired back to back with 'Country Girl,' it just feels like the roof is fixin' to come off the place.","[good, rain, girl]",music
20,Anita Baker,"I made numerous attempts to find a way to do it all, to be a creative singer, songwriter, producer, and to be the mother, daughter, sister, lover, wife. And the thing about music is, with me, that she's a harsh mistress. She does not come to me in the midst of stress.","[mother, stress, daughter]",music
21,Kailash Kher,"Music is the biggest tool of revolution - the best way to reach out to the youth and involve them. If you can't contribute to the world with your art, I don't see the meaning of life.","[life, best, art]",music
22,Amy Grant,Rich Mullins was the uneasy conscience of Christian music. He didn't live like a star. He'd taken a vow of poverty so that what he earned could be used to help others.,"[help others, poverty, help]",music
23,Lisa Marie Presley,"I have loved music so much from when I was little, and I don't know whether it was because I saw my dad doing it and then I got the idea; I don't know what came first... But I always had a hairbrush in the mirror singing. I was always with him backstage; I would go out and be pulled in for the last song.","[dad, mirror, singing]",music
24,Bonnie Raitt,"People say, 'Gee, you don't really do political music.' Well, I sing a lot of songs about how men and women and lovers treat each other, and none of us want to be talked down to or belittled or ignored or disrespected... So I'm proud to be a feminist.","[women, men, political]",music
25,Herbie Hancock,"When the suggestion was made that I might consider doing music of Joni Mitchell, I thought it was a fantastic idea. Joni, I admire not only for her music but for her person, because she's a person that really stands out for what she believes in.","[thought, doing, she]",music
