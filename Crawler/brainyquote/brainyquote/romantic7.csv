0,P. J. O'Rourke,"Kabul is a walled city, which sounds romantic except the walls are pre-cast reinforced concrete blast barriers, 10 feet tall and 15 feet long and moved into place with cranes. The walls are topped with sandbags, and the sandbags are topped with guard posts from which gun barrels protrude.","[gun, feet, city]",romantic
1,Shane Carruth,"I love the concept of the romance that exists when people are broken. Like, the promise of a romance when you're at the bottom. I think that's infinitely compelling and romantic.","[love, people, broken]",romantic
2,Maeve Binchy,We are all the heroes and heroines of our own lives. Our love stories are amazingly romantic; our losses and betrayals and disappointments are gigantic in our own minds.,"[love, heroes, minds]",romantic
3,Gordon Ramsay,"If I can give you one strong piece of advice, when you go away for that romantic weekend, whatever you do, do not accept or take the upgrade to the honeymoon suite.","[strong, advice, accept]",romantic
4,Emmanuel Macron,"A romantic or classical view of the French approach would have been to say, 'It's a French company; let no one attack it. Let's block any merger. But the reality is Alcatel-Lucent is not a French company; it's a global company. Its main markets are China and the U.S. Its ownership is foreign; most of its managers aren't French.","[reality, company, attack]",romantic

7,Dorothy L. Sayers,I love you - I am at rest with you - I have come home.,"[love, home, i love you]",romantic
8,George William Curtis,"Romance like a ghost escapes touching; it is always where you are not, not where you are. The interview or conversation was prose at the time, but it is poetry in the memory.","[time, poetry, memory]",romantic
9,Mae West,A man's kiss is his signature.,"[man, kiss, signature]",romantic
10,Ang Lee,"I think the American West really attracts me because it's romantic. The desert, the empty space, the drama.","[american, me, space]",romantic
11,Brittany Murphy,It's easy to get wrapped up in sharing everyday life with a partner. It's fun to get lost in love and romance. It's the best. But holding on to yourself while doing that is the most important thing.,"[life, love, best]",romantic
12,Daniel Radcliffe,"I don't know where my romanticism comes from. My mom and dad would read to me a lot. 'Treasure Island,' 'Robinson Crusoe,' tales of chivalry and knights, things like that. Those are the stories I loved growing up.","[mom, dad, growing up]",romantic
13,Stendhal,"If you don't love me, it does not matter, anyway I can love for both of us.","[love, me, love me]",romantic
14,Stephen Moyer,Vampires are so old that they don't need to impress anyone anymore. They're comfortable in their own skin. It's this enigmatic strength that's very romantic and old-fashioned. I think it goes back to something of a Victorian attitude of finding a strong man who's going to look after his woman.,"[strength, attitude, strong]",romantic
15,Vilayanur S. Ramachandran,"Science is like a love affair with nature; an elusive, tantalising mistress. It has all the turbulence, twists and turns of romantic love, but that's part of the game.","[love, nature, science]",romantic

21,Aasif Mandvi,"For my parents' generation, the idea was not that marriage was about some kind of idealized, romantic love; it was a partnership. It's about creating family; it's about creating offspring. Indian culture is essentially much more of a 'we' culture. It's a communal culture where you do what's best for the community - you procreate.","[love, family, best]",romantic
22,Jennifer Coolidge,A man's ability to haggle is never a turn-on. The only thing less romantic than how much you paid is how much you saved. The last thing we want to hear is how you talked the jeweler down on our new earrings.,"[man, want, down]",romantic
23,Joe DiMaggio,"The phrase 'off with the crack of the bat', while romantic, is really meaningless, since the outfielder should be in motion long before he hears the sound of the ball meeting the bat.","[meeting, long, sound]",romantic
24,Gary Lineker,"Ooh, it's too embarrassing to share my innermost romantic secrets - although I have written Danielle the odd poem. If anything they are more comedic than romantic. They used to be well-received but that was before she started studying Shakespeare at drama college. Now I feel so inept.","[college, studying, she]",romantic
25,Jack White,"Vinyl is the real deal. I've always felt like, until you buy the vinyl record, you don't really own the album. And it's not just me or a little pet thing or some kind of retro romantic thing from the past. It is still alive.","[pet, past, me]",romantic
