So here's the question: Without a change in leadership, why would the next four years be any different from the last four years?","[life, change, work]",leadership
1,Paul Ryan,"What's missing is leadership in the White House. And the story that Barack Obama does tell, forever shifting blame to the last administration, is getting old. The man assumed office almost four years ago - isn't it about time he assumed responsibility?","[time, responsibility, man]",leadership

13,Madeleine Albright,"But I do not believe that the world would be entirely different if there were more women leaders. Maybe if everybody in leadership was a woman, you might not get into the conflicts in the first place. But if you watch the women who have made it to the top, they haven't exactly been non-aggressive - including me.","[women, woman, believe]",leadership
