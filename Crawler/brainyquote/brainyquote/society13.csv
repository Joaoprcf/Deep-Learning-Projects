11,Marilyn Monroe,"I don't know if high society is different in other cities, but in Hollywood, important people can't stand to be invited someplace that isn't full of other important people.

20,Matt Taibbi,"The threat posed by Bank of America isn't just financial - it's a full-blown assault on the American dream.
