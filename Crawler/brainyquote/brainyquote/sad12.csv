1,Barry Hannah,"I found out about reviews early on. They're mostly written by sad men on bad afternoons. That's probably why I'm less angry than some writers, who are so narcissistic they consider every line of every review, even a thoughtful one, as major treason.","[men, thoughtful, angry]",sad
2,Julie Burchill,"I am firmly of the opinion that women who make a lot of effort to hang onto their looks in middle age (unless they are beauties, entertainers or prostitutes) are rather sad, as one should surely have something more substantial to recommend one by this time, such as kindness or cleverness.","[time, kindness, women]",sad

9,Zoe Kravitz,"Hollywood is like a really sad, grown up version of high school where people get labeled as 'cool,' 'not cool,' 'jock,' 'bombshell,' 'quirky'... it's like a caste system. You're either in, or you're out.","[school, cool, people]",sad

11,Colton Haynes,"Anyone can go online and write anything they want about people they don't even know, and most of the time, that is fueled by hate. The sad part is that people actually believe what they read online.","[time, hate, believe]",sad
12,Natasha Tsakos,"I know theater can improve the quality of people's lives, and I know theater can heal. I've worked as a doctor clown in a hospital for two years.

21,Eminem,I was going to McDonald's and Taco Bell every day. The kids behind the counter knew me - it wouldn't even faze them. Or I'd sit up at Denny's or Big Boy and just eat by myself. It was sad. I got so heavy that people started to not recognize me.,"[myself, day, people]",sad
