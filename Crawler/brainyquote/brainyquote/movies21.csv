0,Drake,"I like Ryan Gosling as an actor. I watch all of his movies, and he's Canadian and I just like his swag. I read his interviews and I'm a big fan of his.","[actor, watch, big]",movies
1,Tate Donovan,"My parents took me to a movie, and I remember wanting to sit apart from them for some reason. I wanted to be a big boy or whatever. I remember looking up on that screen. It was a movie about medieval knights. All I remember is saying, 'I want to do that. I want to make movies.'","[parents, looking, me]",movies
2,Richard Thomas,"I'm one of those weird people that tends to not do the extras and listen to the commentaries and stuff on movies, although I do think they are fascinating and interesting - I'm just so worried that years later I wouldn't remember anything!","[people, remember, weird]",movies
3,Brian K. Vaughan,I sort of jumped out of movies and into the lifeboat of comics. I loved it right away. It was the opposite of film school. Whatever was in my imagination could end up in the finished product. There were just no limitations.,"[end, school, imagination]",movies
4,Ty Simpkins,"I really want to meet and work with JJ Abrams. Everyone talks about what a nice director he is, and he has kids and stuff, so he sounds really awesome, not to mention he makes awesome movies.","[work, want, nice]",movies
5,James Patterson,"One of the nice things about books as opposed to television and movies to some extent is it's not a passive entertainment. People really do get involved, and they do create, and they do have their own visions of what different characters look like and what should happen. It's great - it means their brains are working.","[great, people, happen]",movies
6,Charlie Korsmo,"Making movies was a real weird kind of adult experience. In a way it was like MIT, in that it was a great education. The big lesson is, people are people. They're smart, funny, creative people, but they're people.","[funny, education, experience]",movies
7,Brian J. White,"Every film by Will Smith, Harry Belafonte, Sidney Poitier, Lena Horne, Ruby Dee, Don Cheadle will have great acting and carry good messages in the film. The films starring those actors are the films I tell young people to watch for good acting and to view for quality movies.","[good, great, quality]",movies
8,George Lucas,"I've never been that much of a money guy. I'm more of a film guy, and most of the money I've made is in defense of trying to keep creative control of my movies.","[money, control, creative]",movies
9,Ray Kurzweil,A lot of movies about artificial intelligence envision that AI's will be very intelligent but missing some key emotional qualities of humans and therefore turn out to be very dangerous.,"[intelligence, intelligent]",movies
10,Alfonso Cuaron,"A lot of the films I like are more than fantasies - they're movies fascinated by the technology of space exploration, and they try to honor the laws of physics. I watched the Gregory Peck movie 'Marooned' over and over when I was a kid.","[technology, honor, space]",movies
11,Paul Bloom,"Even in the most peaceful communities, an appetite for violence shows up in dreams, fantasies, sports, play, literature, movies and television. And, so long as we don't transform into angels, violence and the threat of violence - as in punishment and deterrence - is needed to rein in our worst instincts.","[dreams, sports, violence]",movies
12,David Henry Hwang,"If I do a play, it's my vision, and everybody else is working on the production to support that. If I do an opera, I feel like part of my job is to support that composer, to try and create something that allows the composer to do his or her best work. In movies, it's usually the director.","[best, work, vision]",movies
13,Jacqueline MacInnes Wood,"I'm a big horror fan, but I don't enjoy a lot of gore and watching somebody cut their leg off for five hours. I like the older movies where it draws you into the suspense, that sort of shock and awe.","[enjoy, you, watching]",movies
14,Jose Andres,"When you go to watch a baseball game, when you go to watch an NBA game, when you watch an NFL game, when you go to watch movies, the offering that those arenas are doing foodwise is 'all the hot dogs you can eat'; all the French fries you can eat; for $20 you can eat 20 hot dogs.","[baseball, game, doing]",movies
15,Nicole Ari Parker,"I just want to touch something deep in the heart of humanity. I don't know if that's in movies, producing films, or writing a book, but I'm concerned about our spiritual well-being as a human race. I want to impact people in a way that makes us all reach for our best.","[best, deep, spiritual]",movies
16,Glen Duncan,"While I was writing 'The Last Werewolf,' I didn't watch any horror movies.","[writing, watch, horror]",movies
17,Andie MacDowell,"I was fortunate to be able to do two movies with Harold Ramis. He was the kindest of any director with whom I worked. Harold was a genius. On top of his talent, he could do the 'New York Times' crossword puzzle faster than anyone! I am lucky to have known him as well as I did. I will miss him.","[i am, talent, puzzle]",movies
18,Andie MacDowell,"I love 'Forrest Gump;' I like sweet, cheery, happy movies. But it has some dark moments too.","[love, happy, dark]",movies
19,Annette Bening,"With movies, so much of it is, 'Who is the human being that is going to be directing it?' Because it is their medium. In a way, you are serving the director, and when it is someone that you feel you can have a lot of confidence in, it can make a big difference.","[confidence, someone, way]",movies
20,Ridley Scott,"If studios don't get their money back, we don't have any movies. So it is important that films are successful, and I am fully supportive of that because I'm not just a director, I'm also not stupid. I've been in this business long enough and, to a certain extent, I'm a businessman; I know the importance of that.","[business, money, i am]",movies

23,Zach Galligan,"If you stop and think about who was in the 'Lassie' movies, it's difficult to think who was in them, apart from Elizabeth Taylor. You remember the dog, not the people! So if you're going to be in a movie, and it's called 'Gremlins', it's going to be about Gremlins, and what people are going to remember are the Gremlins.","[dog, people, remember]",movies
24,Casey Neistat,I washed dishes so I could make movies. it was never a way for me to make money.,"[money, me, way]",movies
