0,Missy Elliott,I didn't want to be a genius! That ain't cool.,"[want, genius]",cool
1,William Gibson,"'Cyberspace' as a term is sort of over. It's over in the way that, after a certain time, people stopped using the suffix '-electro' to make things cool, because everything was electrical. 'Electro' was all over the early 20th century, and now it's gone. I think 'cyber' is sort of the same way.","[time, people, think]",cool
2,Vivienne Westwood,"The reason why I am proud of my part in the punk movement is that I think it really did implant a message that was already there. The hippies told it to me, but punk made it something cool for people to stand up for, which is that we do not believe government, that we are against government.","[stand up, believe]",cool
3,Ashley Monroe,One of my favorite things to do is sit around and listen to old records... You're forced to listen to the whole thing. And it's so cool digging through the bins trying to find them. I get giddy about records.,"[trying, find, listen]",cool
4,Trey Songz,The thing that is cool about my come up is that I dealt with fame and having money gradually. It didn't happen overnight. It was something that took a while to happen. It was something that humbled me and made me very appreciative of my blessings more than I would have been if it had happened faster and easier.,"[money, blessings, me]",cool
5,P. J. O'Rourke,Horses and horsepower alike are about status and being cool.,"[alike, being, about]",cool
6,Nick Goepper,"I think the Winter Olympics are definitely on a smaller scale than the summer games, but with the inclusion of cool new sports like slope style skiing and snowboarding, it is going to breathe new life into them and attract a whole new crowd.","[life, winter, sports]",cool
7,Anne Fortier,"Even as I pursued a doctorate in the history of ideas in my native Denmark, I realized I had neither the encyclopedic training nor the passion for cool logic - not to mention the nerve - to follow in the footsteps of classical liberal philosophers and economists such as Robert Nozick, Friedrich Hayek, and Milton Friedman.","[history, passion, training]",cool
8,Britt Robertson,I am the oldest of seven. Do my siblings think I'm super cool? I wish they thought I was super cool!,"[i am, thought, wish]",cool
9,Seth Shostak,"Plate tectonics is not all havoc and destruction. The slow movement of continents and ocean floors recycles carbon dioxide dissolved in the oceans back into the atmosphere. Without this slow speed carbon cycle, Earth's temperatures would cool dozens of degrees below your comfort zone.","[ocean, comfort zone, earth]",cool
10,Charlie Trotter,"I never considered Miles Davis a perfectionist; I always considered him as an excellence-ist, where deviation is actually kind of cool.","[kind, perfectionist, him]",cool
11,Theophilus London,I love to hear a cool ambient sound at runway shows. It creates a good energy.,"[love, good, energy]",cool
12,Theophilus London,I always imagined how cool it would be to be the face of a Gap campaign!,"[face, always, campaign]",cool
13,Laura Prepon,"On a lot of shows that I've done, we had the same directors, which was cool. But then, it's also great to do shows where the director changes every week, because you get to see all these different personalities and see what you like dealing with better, as an actor.","[great, week, changes]",cool
14,Michael Eklund,"I don't follow anything that's said about him much, but the Uwe Boll that I know is just a really cool guy. He's just a really quiet, kind and passionate filmmaker who really believes in what he's doing. Like any director that an actor wants to work with, you want a director who's passionate and believes in the work that he's doing.","[work, doing, know]",cool
15,Estelle,"John Legend is a cool guy. He likes to chill, is easy to talk to and hang out with. He's also inspiring on a musical level.","[easy, legend, chill]",cool
16,Pierce Brosnan,"Susanne Bier's work I've always really enjoyed. She's just such a great filmmaker; she's very cool and very sexy - that always helps, too.","[work, great, sexy]",cool
17,Mike Love,Keep a cool head and a warm heart.,"[heart, warm, head]",cool
18,Tracy Morgan,Tracy Morgan is subdued. I'm cool. I'm chilled out.,"[morgan, subdued, chilled]",cool
19,Keith Stanfield,"That was like my safe place with great teachers where everyone could let down their guard and not feel judged. As soon as we walk outside, it was like, 'Look at these weird drama club kids.' But we all had our own agreement that we were cool in our own way.","[great, walk, weird]",cool
20,Chris Eigeman,"I never dreamed I'd be a spokesman for anything. But Pac Bell just asked me. The money was OK; the scripts were fun because I had to do in 30 seconds what it takes a whole feature to do and because the dysfunctional family of agents, managers and lawyers who represent me said it was cool.","[family, money, fun]",cool
21,Riz Ahmed,"Trajectories aren't linear. Life's just a roller coaster. If you're getting a chance to do cool stuff, and it's varied stuff, just enjoy it. I guess I'm a believer in the randomness of life rather than it being a linear trajectory or an arc, a consistent smooth arc, towards anything.","[life, chance, enjoy]",cool
22,Michael Irvin,"We looked at each other standing on the podium, and I think we all were tearing up. But we had to keep it cool. I think we did. Then we let out a breath.","[think, breath, standing]",cool
23,Jon Heder,"I'm not going chic, I swear. The geek endures. But, I mean, a snazzy cool suit looks good.","[good, mean, looks]",cool
24,Magnus Scheving,"You think aerobics is not a cool sport? I think you are wrong. It requires amazing discipline - flexibility, fitness, knowledge. And you have to do it with a big smile on your face. Also, I once performed in front of 10,000 screaming women. I tell you something, I'd rather do that than kick a ball around in front of a few men.","[smile, knowledge, women]",cool
25,Lea Michele,"I was in choir in school. I kind of just did it. I already knew I wanted to sing. My music program in my school wasn't really great - people didn't really want to be part of the choir, they didn't want to do the plays and stuff like that. It definitely wasn't the cool thing to do.","[music, great, school]",cool
