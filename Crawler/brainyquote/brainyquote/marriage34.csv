2,Ellen DeGeneres,"I would love to have the same rights as everybody else. I would love, I don't care if it's called marriage. I don't care if it's called, you know, domestic partnership. I don't care what it's called.","[love, care, know]",marriage
3,Ben Shapiro,What sort of job can you hold in America in which it is safe to hold the personal conviction that same-sex marriage is wrong? The answer: there is no such job. Except Democratic presidential candidate in 2008. Then you're fine.,"[america, job, you]",marriage
4,Ben Shapiro,"The Left despises Texas, with its stellar record of job growth; Texas, with its strong support for traditional marriage and the sanctity of life; Texas, the root of the conservative tree. Should the Left succeed in its attempt to turn Texas purple, America could turn permanently blue.","[life, growth, strong]",marriage
5,Ben Shapiro,The argument that gay marriage doesn't affect straight marriages is a ridiculous red herring: Gay marriage affects society and law in dramatic ways.

Yes, for privileged women like my daughter and all of us here today, but not for most of our sisters in the rest of the world who are still forced into premature marriage, prostitution, forced labor - they have children that they don't want or they cannot feed.","[women, children, today]",marriage
9,Ben Carson,My thoughts are that marriage is between a man and a woman.,"[woman, man, thoughts]",marriage
10,Ben Carson,Marriage is a very sacred institution and should not be degraded by allowing every other type of relationship to be made equivalent to it.,"[relationship, allowing]",marriage
11,Robert Dallek,Vice President Biden's surprising declaration of unqualified support for gay marriage seems to have forced President Obama into a public endorsement of a controversial social issue. It is difficult not to suspect that Biden's pronouncement aimed to give the president some political cover.,"[support, political, gay]",marriage
12,Robert Dallek,Obama's endorsement of gay marriage is hardly as consequential as Johnson's legislative success on civil rights.,"[success, gay, civil rights]",marriage
13,Robert Dallek,"Whatever the long-term legal prospects for same-sex marriage, President Obama's willingness to put the matter front and center in an election year can at least make him a candidate for inclusion in Kennedy's Profiles in Courage.","[courage, election, year]",marriage
14,Robert Dallek,"When Gingrich attacked CNN's John King for bringing up his alleged proposal of an open marriage to his second wife, Gingrich accused him of lowering the level of discourse in a presidential debate, suggesting that such a discussion is unworthy of consideration by voters.","[wife, debate, king]",marriage

19,George Takei,"I think Donald Trump's interpretation of marriage is something that he himself doesn't really believe in. 'Traditional marriage' is where two people love each other, commit to each other, care for each other over the years. It is a meaningful ceremony, and his interpretation of that is not recognizing what real marriage is.","[love, believe, people]",marriage
20,George Takei,"I'd like to think that, when I explain it, that Mr. Trump will understand marriage is defined by two people who love each other, commit to each other, and will care for each other through thick and thin.","[love, people, care]",marriage
21,George Takei,"When Brad and I got married in 2008, it got a lot of attention. And all the attention was over the fact that we were two men, but people were hardly conscious of the fact that we were entering into an interracial marriage. That's wonderful, because it was only 50 years ago with Loving v. Virginia that interracial marriages were made legal.","[men, people, legal]",marriage

24,Bob Newhart,"If you look at Jack Benny, George Burns, or Don Rickles, they've all had long, successful marriages. So, I think there's something about laughter and the durability of a marriage.","[laughter, successful, look]",marriage
25,Rodney Dangerfield,"It's tough to stay married. My wife kisses the dog on the lips, yet she won't drink from my glass.","[dog, wife, tough]",marriage
