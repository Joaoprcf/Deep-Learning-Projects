1,Hayley Mills,"My father was an inspiration to me; I made a few movies with him and I loved working with him.

I was very lucky to have him as a role model.","[love, work, business]",respect
2,Philip Yancey,"You are free to reject God. Make sure that you're really rejecting God, not some caricature of God that the church has shown you. But I, one, respect a God who not only allows us to reject Him but includes the arguments we can use against Him in the Bible. I respect that.","[god, bible, free]",respect
3,Parker Palmer,"Movements begin when oppressed people make - and keep remaking - a deeply inward decision to stop consenting to external demands that contradict a critical inner truth, the truth that they are worthy of respect.","[truth, decision, people]",respect

If I didn't, then everybody would lose.","[working hard, people, easy]",respect
9,Edward Ruscha,"The big pay-off was to work as an artist and gain some shred of respect from your friends, who were also artists.

On the rare occasions you had a gallery show, and sold a little work, well, that was just gravy.","[work, art, friends]",respect
10,Alain de Botton,"It's very hard to respect people on holiday - everybody looks so silly at the beach, it makes you hate humanity - but when you see people at their work they elicit respect, whether it's a mechanic, a stonemason or an accountant.","[work, holiday, hate]",respect
11,Axl Rose,"In general, I usually don't really go by or live my life by a clock, and outside of touring, I don't really ask anyone else to. It's not out of lack of respect for anyone or intentional.","[life, my life, live]",respect

I'm a big fan of Scarface; I'm a big fan of so many people, from Jeezy to... well, there are a lot of people's music that I respect. I don't know who I will collaborate with, but there's a great chance of something happening.","[music, future, great]",respect
18,Amin Maalouf,I have the profoundest respect for people who behave in a generous way because of religion. But I come from a country where the misuse of religion has had catastrophic consequences.

But not unenforced.","[life, baseball, decisions]",respect

24,Julia Cameron,"In limits, there is freedom. Creativity thrives within structure. Creating safe havens where our children are allowed to dream, play, make a mess and, yes, clean it up, we teach them respect for themselves and others.","[freedom, children]",respect
25,Jim Brown,"NASCAR stepped up their safety concepts, and I think the drivers feel NASCAR is doing everything that can be done. So we are a little behind NASCAR in that respect.
