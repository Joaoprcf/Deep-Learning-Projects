2,Rachel Nichols,"Lets talk about the holidays, more specifically, consumption during the holidays.

3,Barry Ritholtz,"Shopmas now begins on Thanksgiving Day. Apparently, escaping the families you cannot stand to spend another minute with on Thanksgiving Day to go buy them gifts is how some Americans show their affection for one another. Weird.","[day, stand, affection]",thanksgiving

9,LZ Granderson,"My son was born during my last semester in college. His due date was Thanksgiving, but he didn't show up until finals week. I brought my books to the hospital and didn't think anything of it. That is what a father is supposed to do.","[father, college, week]",thanksgiving

Growing up, Christmas was always about me, and eventually you, when I finally started to enjoy the giving part. But Thanksgiving is always about us.","[christmas, time, giving]",thanksgiving
14,Debi Mazar,"I'd love to give my girls a traditional Thanksgiving with turkey and all that jazz, but we've raised them to love Tuscan food so much that they don't care for it. My favorite is a nice polenta with beef stew and broccoli rabe on the side.","[love, food, care]",thanksgiving

23,John Madden,"I was introduced to the Turducken in New Orleans. And it wasn't Thanksgiving.

Then Thanksgiving came, and we got one in addition to the traditional turkey.","[good, new, heard]",thanksgiving
24,David Ignatius,"Thanksgiving is America's favorite holiday because it's a time when we put aside our cares, much as the struggling Pilgrims did nearly four centuries ago, and eat a gut-busting meal without worrying about the 'out years.'","[time, holiday, america]",thanksgiving
