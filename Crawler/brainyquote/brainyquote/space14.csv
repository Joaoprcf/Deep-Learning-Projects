0,Andy Serkis,"When I was in theater I was forever trying to inhabit a space which puts yourself under the microscope as an actor and your personality and your take on life, but actually through another portal of a character.","[life, character, personality]",space
1,Jane Campion,"Because there is that sort of feeling that people don't know what to do with gaps in their lives. It's a scary notion, but actually, if you can stand in space just for a little while, a new door will open, or you'll be able to see in the dark after a while. You'll adjust.","[door, people, dark]",space
2,Jonathan Sacks,"Religious ritual is a way of structuring time so that we, not employers, the market or the media, are in control. Life needs its pauses, its chapter breaks, if the soul is to have space to breathe.","[life, time, soul]",space
3,Abbie Cornish,"Growing up on a farm was the best. I remember loving that expanse of space. The sky at night was so clear, I could see every star.","[best, sky, night]",space
4,Carrie Ann Inaba,I have arthritis. The space around my spinal cord has become compressed.,"[arthritis, spinal, become]",space
5,Burt Rutan,"By 1931, after a few years' experience of flying scheduled airlines, those planes were operating at roughly 600 times the safety of the space shuttle. I look at safety not in terms of fatalities per passenger-mile, but when you get in and close the door, what is the risk of dying on this flight?","[experience, safety, risk]",space
6,Neil deGrasse Tyson,"Asteroids have us in our sight. The dinosaurs didn't have a space program, so they're not here to talk about this problem. We are, and we have the power to do something about it. I don't want to be the embarrassment of the galaxy, to have had the power to deflect an asteroid, and then not, and end up going extinct.","[science, power, end]",space
7,Patanjali,"Knowledge born of the finest discrimination takes us to the farthest shore. It is intuitive, omniscient, and beyond all divisions of time and space.","[time, knowledge]",space
8,James Dashner,"Don't ever let the other stuff get in the way of your inherent skills as a kick-butt storyteller. Move the reader, make them happy and sad and excited and scared. Make them stare into space after they've put the book down, thinking about the tale that's become a part of them.","[sad, happy, book]",space
9,Nathan Myhrvold,"We collectively have a special place in our heart for the manned space flight program - Apollo nostalgia is one element, but that is only part of it. American culture worships explorers - look at the fame of Lewis and Clark, for example. The American people want to think of themselves as supporting exploration.","[culture, heart, people]",space
10,David Icke,What we call the 'world' and the 'universe' is only one frequency range in an infinite number sharing the same space. The interdimensional entities I write about are able to move between these frequencies or dimensions and manipulate our lives.,"[universe, world, sharing]",space
11,Brian Greene,String theory envisions a multiverse in which our universe is one slice of bread in a big cosmic loaf. The other slices would be displaced from ours in some extra dimension of space.,"[universe, dimension, bread]",space
12,Alain de Botton,"On paper, being good sounds great but a lot depends on the atmosphere of the workplace or community we live in. We tend to become good or bad depending on the cues sent out within a particular space.","[good, community, great]",space
13,Joe Lo Truglio,"I grew up down in Florida, and in the Keys, there's this place called Sea Camp which was not unlike Space Camp, except you explored the sea. And so that kind of whetted my appetite for that. But then I ended up swimming in a lagoon full of Cassiopeia jellyfish, and that quickly quashed that desire to be a marine biologist.","[sea, swimming, desire]",space
14,Martin Rees,"We need to broaden our sympathies both in space and time - and perceive ourselves as part of a long heritage, and stewards for an immense future.","[time, future, heritage]",space
15,Renzo Piano,A piazza is not a plaza. The plaza is the theme park of the piazza; the plaza is the commercial version. A piazza is an empty space with no function. This is what Europeans understand.,"[theme, understand, empty]",space
16,Akon,I always try to give my own albums space in between so I have time to create a new sound and give time for people to miss me. You have to come out fresh and reinvent yourself.,"[time, yourself, people]",space
17,Peter Cullen,"I'm always involved with the Aerospace Program and NASA and Goddard Space Flight Center. And if kids feel so inclined, they can log onto NASA and the Optimus Prime Spinoff Award, which we present every year to some of the brilliant young minds that are taking up into the academics of space, science, technology, math.","[technology, science, year]",space
18,Kathleen Hanna,"Since I loved underground music, I tried to carve a space for feminism within it. Those were my hopes.","[music, loved, feminism]",space
19,Andrea Hirata,"The decision to write full-time meant I couldn't afford to buy a house. A friend kindly offered me the use of his apartment in a thirty-six-story building full of newlywed couples in the southern area of Jakarta. I didn't like my working space at first, but the scenery and everything going on outside have worked their magic on me.","[decision, me, building]",space
20,Eugene Cernan,"After Apollo 17, America stopped looking towards the next horizon. The United States had become a space-faring nation, but threw it away. We have sacrificed space exploration for space exploitation, which is interesting but scarcely visionary.","[america, looking, horizon]",space
21,James E. Faust,"We are bombarded on all sides by a vast number of messages we don't want or need. More information is generated in a single day than we can absorb in a lifetime. To fully enjoy life, all of us must find our own breathing space and peace of mind.","[life, peace, mind]",space
22,A. R. Rahman,"It's true that I love to connect with my fans on the social networking sites, but I try not to go overboard, ever. I just give people a peek into my mind space, but never bombard them with my tweets.","[love, mind, people]",space
23,Ray Bradbury,We've gotta reinvest in space travel. We should've never left the moon.,"[travel, moon, never]",space
24,Cynthia Ozick,"Profound subject matter can be encompassed in small space - for proof, look at any sonnet by Shakespeare!","[small, look, matter]",space
25,Deborah Mailman,"I grew up with horses and cattle, running around on dirt hills with this real sense of space. We didn't have neighbours - well, the nearest ones were kilometres away.","[real, away, cattle]",space
