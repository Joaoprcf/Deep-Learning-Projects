0,Dan Gable,My coaches were great. My mom and dad. My dad never missed a wrestling meet.,"[dad, great, wrestling]",mom
1,Summer Sanders,"I lead by example. My kids know what sweat is. They've seen me come home from so many runs and asked, 'What's on your skin? How did you get it?' And I tell them, 'It's from exercise!' So now my son will come home from a bike ride, take off his helmet and say, 'Look, Mom. I'm sweating! I just worked out!'","[home, son, me]",mom

4,Erich Fromm,"The mother-child relationship is paradoxical and, in a sense, tragic. It requires the most intense love on the mother's side, yet this very love must help the child grow away from the mother, and to become fully independent.","[love, relationship, mother]",mom
5,Henry Ward Beecher,The mother's heart is the child's schoolroom.,"[mother, heart, child]",mom
6,Emmanuelle Chriqui,"I look at my father. He is one of my heroes. He is such an incredible, classy man.

When I see all that he did, I think, 'Wow, that's a really wonderful man.'","[father, great, tough times]",mom
7,Vanessa Williams,"I think there's a time to work, and everyone has to kind of adjust. And then there's a time to relax, and be the mom or take the kids on vacation when you need to wind down. So it's a matter of planning, and being able to map out your year or your week or let's start with the day. It is just being multi-tasking and being available.","[work, time, day]",mom
8,Emma Roberts,"I grew up with just my mom. She and I were like best friends. She's a very independent woman and I admire that about her. In my life, I've tried to be like that. To be okay with being on my own and being independent.","[life, best, woman]",mom
9,Mike Vogel,"When my wife and I met, I couldn't talk to her - and my defense mechanism is sarcasm. I belittle someone with verbal pokes and prods. I did it to her out of complete awe. When friends introduced us, I said 'Hi' - and turned my back. Later, I called my mom and best friend and said, 'I think I just met my wife.'","[best, best friend, wife]",mom
10,Marlo Thomas,"When I was growing up, my mother was always a friend to my siblings and me (in addition to being all the other things a mom is), and I was always grateful for that because I knew she was someone I could talk to and joke with, and argue with and that nothing would ever harm that friendship.","[friendship, mother, grateful]",mom

14,Imogen Heap,"Most of the time, the lyrics are kind of like my secret messages to my friends or my boyfriend or my mom or my dad.

Often, when I sit down to write a lyric, it is in the heat of the moment, and something has just happened.","[time, dad, friends]",mom
15,Fred Armisen,"My father came from Germany. My mom came from Venezuela. My father's culturally German, but his father was Japanese. I was raised in New York and spent two years in Rio. My parents met at the University of Southern Mississippi, and they had me there, and then we moved to New York. I'm not very familiar with Mississippi.","[father, parents, me]",mom
16,Vanilla Ice,"My mom raised me to be clean, so it's in my nature. I have two little girls, and I'm married, but we've got a nanny and a maid.","[nature, me, little girls]",mom
17,Gerard Butler,"I've had broken bones and cuts and dashes and tears from movies, but when I was five, my mom put the biscuits up high so we wouldn't be helping ourselves. So, one day I asked to stand up on a chair to get a biscuit, and it fell, and the corner of the chair went right into the side of my eye, and it made a big hole in there.","[stand up, day, eye]",mom
18,Chris Pine,"We come from fallible parents who were kids once, who decided to have kids and who had to learn how to be parents. Faults are made and damage is done, whether it's conscious or not. Everyone's got their own 'stuff,' their own issues, and their own anger at Mom and Dad. That is what family is. Family is almost naturally dysfunctional.","[family, dad, anger]",mom

21,Cat Cora,"My humanitarian work evolved from being with my family. My mom, my dad, they really set a great example for giving back. My mom was a nurse, my dad was a school teacher. But my mom did a lot of things for geriatrics and elderly people. She would do home visits for free.","[family, work, teacher]",mom
22,Rainey Qualley,"I always was drawn to the performing arts. I started dancing when I was two. I sang, loved to act, and loved going to visit my mom on-set. But she wanted me to have a normal childhood, so I wasn't really allowed to pursue acting till I got older.","[childhood, me, loved]",mom
23,Avril Lavigne,I don't want to have kids for like 10 years. I still have a lot to do. I don't even know if I could handle a dog right now. I'm so not ready. Someday I'll be a mom but not until I'm in my 30s.,"[dog, know, want]",mom
24,Tim Allen,"Dad needs to show an incredible amount of respect and humor and friendship toward his mate so the kids understand their parents are sexy, they're fun, they do things together, they're best friends.
