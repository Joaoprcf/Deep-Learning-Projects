1,Jane Siberry,"'The Taxi Ride,' from my second album, is one people want to hear a lot. I'm consciously trying to walk on the sunny side of the street, to really lift myself into a place of greater positivity, and that's a sad song.","[myself, people, trying]",sad
2,Pixie Lott,"I take my inspiration for the song writing from little experiences, not even if I've experienced them myself but say if something has made me sad, I will use that emotion. I just use everyday life and write about it.","[life, myself, writing]",sad
3,Sania Mirza,"I think people tend to forget that as celebrities we are still human. We have the same emotions - we cry, we have fun, we laugh, we get sad, and we get hurt.

4,Bjorn Ulvaeus,"The music of ABBA is not that happy. It might sound happy, in some strange way, but deep within, it's not happy music. It has that Nordic melancholic feeling to it. What fools you is the girls' voices. You know, I do think that is one of the secrets about ABBA. Even when we were really quite sad, we always sounded jubilant.","[music, happy, deep]",sad
5,Graham Greene,"Morality comes with the sad wisdom of age, when the sense of curiosity has withered.","[wisdom, age, curiosity]",sad
6,Stephen Graham Jones,"Making people laugh is so much more difficult than making them sad. Too much fiction defaults to the somber, the tragic.

7,Riley Keough,"You play to different parts of yourself when you take on various roles. Like, you are your confident self when you're playing this person, and you're your sad self when playing another person - but it's all a part of you somewhere.","[self, yourself, you]",sad

9,Rachel Stevens,"Ideally, I would love to mix singing and acting, but you can only be a pop star for so many years. I mean, at 30 it's a little bit sad, right?","[love, singing, acting]",sad
10,Margot Kidder,"With any group of people in life, sad things happen, and crazy things, and happy things. When you're in the public eye, it's just amplified, that's all.","[life, happy, crazy]",sad
11,Shelby Lynne,"I think a lot of people think that my parents' deaths is why I write such sad songs, but that's not true. Those songs may just be the woman I am.","[parents, woman, i am]",sad

But as soon as I'm starting to make something, it's when I'm the happiest. Ever. I think that comes out at the same time, so there's that juxtaposition.","[time, myself, lonely]",sad
16,Sarah MacLean,"There is perhaps no more rewarding romance heroine than she who is not expected to find love. The archetype comes in many disguises - the wallflower, the spinster, the governess, the single mom - but always with one sad claim: Love is not in her cards.","[love, mom, love is]",sad

19,Mallory Ortberg,"Ghost! I miss him! Is that weird? I miss him even though I invented him. I feel a lot of tenderness toward him. I don't write a lot of stuff that is sad or that is tender and affectionate, so that has a very special place in my heart.","[heart, weird, place]",sad
20,Jeff Ament,I love sad. Sadness makes you feel more than anything.,"[love, sadness, you]",sad
21,Paul O'Grady,"I think it's bad for fellas when they lose their mothers. Mine was such a character. Oh it was sad, really sad. And, with her gone, the family home was gone, so what was left of any roots I had were completely dug up.","[family, home, character]",sad
22,Kristin Davis,"It's nice to be with someone, but I don't think you need to be in a relationship to feel complete. That would be really sad.","[relationship, someone, nice]",sad
