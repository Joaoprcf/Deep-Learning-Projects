0,Steve Jobs,"Bottom line is, I didn't return to Apple to make a fortune. I've been very lucky in my life and already have one. When I was 25, my net worth was $100 million or so. I decided then that I wasn't going to let it ruin my life. There's no way you could ever spend it all, and I don't view wealth as something that validates my intelligence.","[life, money, wealth]",intelligence
1,Stephen Hawking,It is not clear that intelligence has any long-term survival value.,"[survival, value, clear]",intelligence
2,Stephen Hawking,"As Irving Good realised in 1965, machines with superhuman intelligence could repeatedly improve their design even further, triggering what Vernor Vinge called a 'singularity.'","[good, design, improve]",intelligence
3,John F. Kennedy,I don't think the intelligence reports are all that hot. Some days I get more out of the New York Times.,"[think, new york, hot]",intelligence
4,Rand Paul,"To defend our country we need to gather intelligence on the enemy, but when the intelligence lies to Congress, how are we to trust them? The phone records of law abiding citizens are none of their damn business.","[business, trust, law]",intelligence
5,Robert Kiyosaki,"I want parents to teach that academic intelligence is essential, but so is financial intelligence.","[parents, financial, want]",intelligence
6,David Bowie,"I'm in awe of the universe, but I don't necessarily believe there's an intelligence or agent behind it. I do have a passion for the visual in religious rituals, though, even though they may be completely empty and bereft of substance.","[passion, believe, universe]",intelligence
7,Wayne Dyer,There is not a separate God for each person. There is one universal intelligence flowing through all of us.,"[god, person, universal]",intelligence
8,Elliott Abrams,"The Obama administration appears to regard intelligence leaks and briefings more or less like briefings by the Democratic National Committee or White House flack Jay Carney. You use any information at hand, classified or not, and you spin it any way you like, fairly or not.","[information, way, you]",intelligence
9,Elliott Abrams,"What does 'politicizing intelligence' mean? Using intel, or more often, partial intel, to produce an effect in line with White House policies rather than giving a full picture of a particular situation.","[giving, situation, picture]",intelligence
10,Elliott Abrams,"In the spring of 2007, Israeli intelligence brought to Washington proof that the Assad regime in Syria was building a nuclear reactor along the Euphrates - with North Korean help. This reactor was a copy of the Yongbyon reactor the North Koreans had built, and was part of a Syrian nuclear weapons program.","[help, spring, building]",intelligence
11,Ezra Taft Benson,"Husbands, recognize your wife's intelligence and her ability to counsel with you as a real partner regarding family plans, family activities, and family budgeting. Don't be stingy with your time or with your means. Give her the opportunity to grow intellectually, emotionally, and socially as well as spiritually.","[family, time, opportunity]",intelligence
12,Penn Jillette,"The highest ideals are human intelligence, creativity and love. Respect these above all.","[love, respect, creativity]",intelligence
13,Buzz Aldrin,"We could have human intelligence in orbit around Mars, building things there.","[building, mars, human]",intelligence
14,Brian Eno,"When our governments want to sell us a course of action, they do it by making sure it's the only thing on the agenda, the only thing everyone's talking about. And they pre-load the ensuing discussion with highly selected images, devious and prejudicial language, dubious linkages, weak or false 'intelligence' and selected 'leaks.'","[language, action, want]",intelligence
15,Brian Eno,"I believe that singing is the key to long life, a good figure, a stable temperament, increased intelligence, new friends, super self-confidence, heightened sexual attractiveness, and a better sense of humor.","[life, good, humor]",intelligence
16,Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu,"I think intelligence basically can be in a way defined by the possibility of having two opposite ideas living together and at the same time functioning. That's why I think a smart script has two things living in the same place, and they're absolutely contradictory.","[time, together, smart]",intelligence
17,Robert Green Ingersoll,There can be goodness without much intelligence - but it seems to me that perfect intelligence and perfect goodness must go together.,"[together, me, perfect]",intelligence
18,Robert Green Ingersoll,"Intelligence, integrity and courage are the great pillars that support the State. Above all, the citizens of a free nation should honor the brave and independent man - the man of stainless integrity, of will and intellectual force.","[courage, integrity, great]",intelligence
19,Robert Green Ingersoll,"As long as we can get redress in the courts, as long as the laws shall be honestly administered, as long as honesty and intelligence sit upon the bench, as long as intelligence sits in the chairs of jurors, this country will stand, the law will be enforced, and the law will be respected.","[honesty, law, stand]",intelligence
20,Bertrand Russell,"Religion is something left over from the infancy of our intelligence, it will fade away as we adopt reason and science as our guidelines.","[science, religion, reason]",intelligence
21,Seth Shostak,The total funding of SETI (the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) in the U.S. is 0.0003 percent of the tax monies spent on health and human services. And it's not even tax money. The SETI Institute's hunt for signals is funded by donations.,"[money, health, search]",intelligence
22,Seth Shostak,"Most of the intelligence out there must be artificial intelligence. We keep looking for critters like us living on a planet like ours, where in fact the majority of the intelligence out there is not biological. That would be my argument.","[looking, living, argument]",intelligence
23,Seth Shostak,"The thing to keep in mind is that we're still in the very early days when it comes to the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. Saying there's a silence is a bit like if Columbus, looking to discover a new continent, only sailed 10 miles off the coast of Spain before turning back to say, 'Nothing out there!'","[silence, mind, looking]",intelligence
24,Seth Shostak,"The cosmos is three times as old as Earth. During most of creation's 14 billion year history, our solar system wasn't around. Nonetheless, the early universe still had the right stuff for life, and contained worlds that were just as suitable for spawning biology and intelligence as our own.","[life, history, universe]",intelligence
25,Seth Shostak,Humans have existed only for the last 0.001 percent of cosmic time. All of which says that - unless the Homo sapiens brain is the one-and-only instance of cogitating machinery - nearly all the intelligence that's out there is beyond our level. And that intelligence is more than just a little bit beyond.,"[time, brain, beyond]",intelligence
