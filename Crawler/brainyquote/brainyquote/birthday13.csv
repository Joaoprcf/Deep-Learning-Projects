1,Sophie Turner,"Just before my 16th birthday, Natalie Dormer said to me, 'As soon as you turn 16, you're going to work adult hours. People will try take advantage of you, so it's important not to be a pushover.'","[work, people, me]",birthday

5,Shashi Tharoor,"I have been a frequent air traveler since I was a few months shy of my sixth birthday, when my parents packed me off to boarding school two plane rides away from home.

6,Candice Olson,"Ask any teenage girl to describe her perfect bedroom, and you'll get answers like 'a room with a private phone line, a place to hang out with friends, and for it to be way-cool and funky.'

7,Sara Sheridan,"I have an ambivalent relationship with Margaret Thatcher. She came to power in May 1979 - a month before my 11th birthday.

14,Sevyn Streeter,"One thing that was really dope for me was that my dad had a '78 Corvette, '78 or '76 Corvette all my life. It always needed to be fixed up.

17,Clive Thompson,"When you're an expert in a subject, you can retain new factoids on your favorite topic easily. This only works for the subjects you're truly passionate about, though.

21,Annette Funicello,In 1993 my birthday present was a star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame.,"[walk, fame, present]",birthday
22,Aimee Bender,I like birthday cake. It's so symbolic. It's a tempting symbol to load with something more complicated than just 'Happy birthday!' because it's this emblem of childhood and a happy day.,"[happy, day, childhood]",birthday
23,Phillip Phillips,"I'm not big on dark chocolate, but I do have a sweet tooth, so it gets me in trouble. I love warm chocolate chip cookies with ice cream.
