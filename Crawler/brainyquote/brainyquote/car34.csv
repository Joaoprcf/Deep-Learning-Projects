1,Ric Ocasek,"People sometimes say that bands sound like The Cars, but when I hear it I don't know if they do or not.","[people, know, sound]",car
2,Ric Ocasek,"I didn't feel like gymnastics were part of The Cars. I certainly philosophically didn't want to prod the audience to react to anything. To me, it was more like negative theater. We didn't really talk to the audience. I didn't see that being a part of this band.","[me, negative, want]",car
3,Rick Wagoner,"What I've seen around the world is if the regulatory desires are combined with things that affect consumer behavior - such as in Europe, they tax gasoline very heavily - you do get people to move to very fuel efficient cars; trade off bigger vs. smaller cars.","[world, people, behavior]",car
4,Linda Ronstadt,"Ninety-eight percent of the singing I did was private singing - it was in the shower, at the dishwasher, driving my car, singing with the radio, whatever. I can't do any of that now. I wish I could. I don't miss performing, particularly, but I miss singing.","[singing, wish, driving]",car
5,Pierce Brosnan,I know what it's like to be famous. It's good money and it's great fun. A real kick in the pants. People wave at you and smile at you. You get great tables in restaurants. They send you gifts - beautiful clothes and cars.,"[smile, money, good]",car
6,Peter Criss,There's not a day that goes by that I don't bless myself with holy water and then get in my car and rub the medal of the Virgin Mary that she gave me and say a Hail Mary for my mother. And then I kiss her Mass card that's right there on the dashboard.,"[myself, mother, water]",car
7,Charles Dance,"I've done maybe twelve of Shakespeare's plays. I was with the Royal Shakespeare Company for years. Whatever influence that has never leaves you. If you learn to drive a car, and you learn the right way if there is ever a right way. You learn the good aspects, you learn to drive properly. And that never leaves you.","[good, influence, learn]",car
8,Natalie Martinez,I like cars. I know some things. I can change my own car and battery and change my own oil.,"[change, know, oil]",car
9,Lindsay Wagner,"There's no way we could take cars off the planet and not have our society fall apart. So they're a necessary evil, in that sense.","[society, evil, fall]",car
10,Al Roker,"Because you're fat, you feel that everybody's watching every bite you take. So, you closet-eat, and you think because nobody sees you eating, then you're not eating. You know, if you're eating a Big Mac in a closed car, can anybody hear you nosh? If I ate only what people saw me eat, I would've probably been about 170 pounds.","[people, me, know]",car
11,Bonnie Tyler,"When I do a T.V. show, I hear all these artists in their dressing rooms doing scales - I've never done it because I've never had voice training. What I do to prepare is get in my car and sing along to the radio for about 20 minutes.","[training, voice, doing]",car
12,Orlando Bloom,I used to ride motorbikes and drive cars like everything was a racetrack; it was ridiculous. It wasn't because I thought it was cool; it was just because I loved living on the edge. But I've chilled.,"[cool, thought, living]",car
13,Sebastian Thrun,"As a child, I spent a lot of time with things like Lego, building trains, cars, complex structures, and I really liked that.","[time, child, building]",car
14,Michael Schumacher,Those who have come into Formula One without experiencing cars devoid of electronic aids will find it tough. To control 800 horse power relying just on arm muscles and foot sensitivity can turn out to be a dangerous exercise.,"[power, horse, control]",car
15,Josh Hartnett,"My interests are guitars, cars, and vacation. I've been playing guitar all my life. My dad was a professional guitarist, but I'm terrible, which lets me off the hook, so I just play for myself.","[life, dad, myself]",car
16,Elizabeth Warren,"I pay for homeowner's insurance, I pay for car insurance, I pay for health insurance.","[health, insurance, pay]",car
17,Beverley Mitchell,"In real life, one of my friends was killed in a car accident during our sophomore year.","[life, friends, year]",car
18,Bode Miller,"We should tell our kids to just have fun, participate and not get bent on winning or losing. But every coach, when they say that, they say it tongue in cheek, 'Don't worry about winning': If you win I'll get you ice cream, but if you lose I'm going to pout in the car.","[winning, losing, fun]",car
19,Bob Uecker,"The biggest thrill a ballplayer can have is when your son takes after you. That happened when my Bobby was in his championship Little League game. He really showed me something. Struck out three times. Made an error that lost the game. Parents were throwing things at our car and swearing at us as we drove off. Gosh, I was proud.","[parents, son, proud]",car
20,Eric Fellner,You can't develop a great car and sell it as an independent. You can develop a great car and make a deal with Mercedes.,"[great, you, mercedes]",car
21,Peter Singer,"Robots already perform many functions, from making cars to defusing bombs - or, more menacingly, firing missiles.

22,James Norman Hall,"Remote villages and communities have lost their identity, and their peace and charm have been sacrificed to that worst of abominations, the automobile.","[peace, identity, lost]",car
23,Ed Markey,You have to wait six months to purchase a fuel efficient automobile made from overseas.,"[wait, you, automobile]",car
24,Iqbal Quadir,"In America, people buy cars, and they put very little money down. They get a car, and they go to work. The work pays them a salary; the salary allows them to pay for the car over time. The car pays for itself.","[work, time, money]",car
25,Erma Bombeck,My kids always perceived the bathroom as a place where you wait it out until all the groceries are unloaded from the car.,"[wait, place, you]",car
