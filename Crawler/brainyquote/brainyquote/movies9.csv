12,Claire Danes,It's very difficult to judge yourself. Extreme self-doubt is only attractive when it's fictionalized. Which is why people love the movies. They are so reassuring.,"[love, yourself, people]",movies
13,Carol Burnett,"My grandmother and I would go see movies, and we'd come back to the apartment - we had a one-room apartment in Hollywood - and I would kind of lock myself in this little dressing room area with a cracked mirror on the door and act out what I had just seen.","[myself, mirror, door]",movies

I'm doing a very unique nail polish line, and finally, I'm developing a hair care line because people always ask me about my hair care system.

19,Quentin Tarantino,"I just grew up watching a lot of movies. I'm attracted to this genre and that genre, this type of story, and that type of story.

20,Emmanuel Lubezki,"The dynamic range of the digital camera is pretty crappy compared to film, but now film is not great because the labs have closed.
