8,Douglas Wilder,"Government or politics in America today is big business.

20,Bobby Seale,"Electoral politics was always an objective of the Black Panther party, so Barack Obama is a part of what we dreamed and struggled and died for.","[black, party, electoral]",politics

24,August Wilson,All art is political in the sense that it serves someone's politics.,"[art, political, someone]",politics
25,Paul Conroy,"Britain, along with the U.S.A., is war weary, and after the travesty of Iraq and Afghanistan, has grave misgivings in any future involvement in the Middle East. The ghost of Tony Blair and his single-minded determination to attack Iraq, at any cost, has cast a long shadow over British politics. The British public have a long collective memory.","[war, future, determination]",politics
