0,Libba Bray,"My joke is that my father was a minister and my mother was an English teacher, so I'm trained to see the world in terms of symbols, which is hard when you just want to make toast.","[father, mother, world]",teacher
1,Nicole Ari Parker,"I had a brilliant drama teacher while I was at Roland Park: Ann Mainolfi. But the school was mostly rich in academics. It wasn't like I was prepping myself for a life in acting. There, you prepped yourself to have a stable future. The school's piece de resistance is college prep - it didn't teach you how to audition for a TV show.","[life, future, myself]",teacher
2,Santiago Cabrera,"My English teacher always gave me scripts for plays, but I was into sports. My friend said there were small parts I could go up for, but the director gave me the part of Mozart, which was kind of the lead role. From then on I just loved it.","[sports, small, me]",teacher
3,D. B. Sweeney,"I had a teacher senior year in high school. He was a theater teacher, and he basically was a little bit like 'High School Musical.' He kind of encouraged the jocks to get involved with the plays. I did it as kind of a senior year lark.","[school, year, senior]",teacher
4,Roma Downey,"Mary and Jesus had this extraordinary relationship between them. What a teacher Mary is, really. It is the ultimate trusting; that she had to trust God, that she was so privileged to be the mother of the Savior, that she had to stand there as a mother and watch her son being murdered and trust that that is what he came to do.","[relationship, trust, god]",teacher
5,Deborah Mailman,"About Grade 9 and Grade 10, I had a fantastic drama teacher, and it was one of the first subjects I actually felt that I was good at. I wasn't a mathematician. Didn't like science, any of those subjects. English and Drama were the two subjects that I loved and felt that I was good at.","[science, good, loved]",teacher
6,Lewis B. Smedes,"In a sinful world, no community can exist for long where nobody is ever held accountable: no teacher would grade a student's performance; no citizen would sit on a jury or call a failed leader to account.","[community, leader, world]",teacher
7,Tony Danza,"I always wanted to be a teacher. I went to school to be a teacher. And I've always, you know, had this sort of romantic idea about it. But I'm worried about - I'm worried about education.","[education, romantic, school]",teacher
8,Tony Danza,"What happened is, when I was doing 'Taxi,' the last year, we did this thing where we had on top hats and tails, and we pretended to tap-dance. And I said to myself, 'You know, I always wanted to know how to do this.' So I got myself a teacher, and I started studying, and I got hooked.","[myself, year, studying]",teacher
9,Peggy Lipton,"In acting class, I used to hide in the corner and pray the teacher wouldn't call on me.","[me, acting, class]",teacher
10,Ken Stott,"I read 'the Hobbit' at the age when you're supposed to read it. I didn't read 'The Lord Of The Rings.' My father, who was an English teacher, advised me that once I had read 'the Hobbit,' that would be enough. I could then move on to Dostoyevsky.","[father, age, me]",teacher
11,Rita Ora,"I was always getting told off by my choir teacher for, you know, riffing when I shouldn't.","[know, you, always]",teacher
12,Audre Lorde,"There's always someone asking you to underline one piece of yourself - whether it's Black, woman, mother, dyke, teacher, etc. - because that's the piece that they need to key in to. They want to dismiss everything else.","[mother, woman, yourself]",teacher
13,Joseph B. Wirthlin,"We are all busy. It's easy to find excuses for not reaching out to others, but I imagine they will sound as hollow to our Heavenly Father as the elementary school boy who gave his teacher a note asking that he be excused from school March 30th through the 34th.","[father, school, busy]",teacher
14,Bono,"When people say, you know, 'Good teacher,' 'Prophet,' 'Really nice guy'... this is not how Jesus thought of Himself. So you're left with a challenge in that, which is either Jesus was who he said he was or a complete and utter nut case. You have to make a choice on that.","[good, challenge, people]",teacher
15,J. Robert Oppenheimer,"My mother was born in Baltimore, and before her marriage, she was an artist and teacher of art.","[art, marriage, mother]",teacher

17,Kevin Mitnick,"The first programming assignment I had in high school was to find the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. Instead, I thought it would be cooler to write a program to get the teacher's password and all the other students' passwords. And the teacher gave me an A and told the class how smart I was.","[school, smart, thought]",teacher
18,Rush Limbaugh,"Police and firefighters are great, but they don't create wealth. They protect it. That's crucial. Teaching is a wonderful profession. Teachers help educate people to become good citizens so that citizens can then go create wealth. But they don't create the wealth themselves.","[good, great, police]",teacher
19,James Levine,I was lucky that I met the right mentors and teachers at the right moment.,"[moment, lucky, mentors]",teacher

22,John Legend,Experience is a great teacher.,"[experience, great]",teacher
23,Bill Bowerman,"A teacher is never too smart to learn from his pupils. But while runners differ, basic principles never change. So it's a matter of fitting your current practices to fit the event and the individual. See, what's good for you might not be worth a darn for the next guy.","[change, good, smart]",teacher
24,Jonathan Kozol,"The contrasts between what is spent today to educate a child in the poorest New York City neighborhoods, where teacher salaries are often even lower than the city averages, and spending levels in the wealthiest suburban areas are daunting challenges to any hope New Yorkers might retain that even semblances of fairness still prevail.","[hope, today, challenges]",teacher
25,Laura Esquivel,"As a teacher I realize that what one learns in school doesn't serve for very much at all, that the only thing one can really learn is self-understanding, and this is something that can't be taught.","[school, learn, realize]",teacher
