0,Amy Brenneman,"I remember when we had to pick our major freshman year, I chose comparative religion. It came to me out of the blue. I am amazed at how interested I still am in those ideas, especially the way spirituality is expressed in the world and in art.","[art, i am, world]",religion

2,Martin Amis,"If God existed, and if He cared for humankind, He would never have given us religion.","[god, never, us]",religion
3,Paul Davies,"In science, a healthy skepticism is a professional necessity, whereas in religion, having belief without evidence is regarded as a virtue.","[science, healthy, belief]",religion
4,Rupert Sheldrake,"Bad religion is arrogant, self-righteous, dogmatic and intolerant. And so is bad science. But unlike religious fundamentalists, scientific fundamentalists do not realize that their opinions are based on faith. They think they know the truth.","[science, truth, faith]",religion
5,Richard Rohr,"If our love of God does not directly influence, and even change, how we engage in the issues of our time on this earth, I wonder what good religion is.","[love, change, time]",religion

7,Sam Harris,"Religion has convinced us that there's something else entirely other than concerns about suffering. There's concerns about what God wants, there's concerns about what's going to happen in the afterlife.","[god, suffering, happen]",religion
8,Gary Hamel,"Over the centuries, religion has become institutionalized, and in the process encrusted with elaborate hierarchies, top-heavy bureaucracies, highly specialized roles and reflexive routines.","[process, over, become]",religion
9,Vinod Khosla,"Religion asks you to believe things without questioning, and technology and science always encourage you to ask hard questions and why it is important in science and technology. So I was always interested in science and technology.","[technology, science, believe]",religion
10,Mohsin Hamid,"I think if you say that art and politics, or religion and politics, mustn't mix, don't mix, that is itself a political statement. Even if you are writing a 19th-century novel where the money comes from a plantation in the Caribbean and you don't talk about that, that itself is a political thing.","[art, money, politics]",religion
11,Neil Postman,"TV serves us most usefully when presenting junk-entertainment; it serves us most ill when it co-opts serious modes of discourse - news, politics, science, education, commerce, religion.","[education, science, politics]",religion
12,Tariq Ramadan,"The 21st century - and the atheists - needs the presence of religion, just as religion must deal with the real challenges and the thinkers of the day in order to sharpen the conscience and the intelligence of those who study the timeless sacred texts in a spirit of responding to the questions of their time.","[time, intelligence, day]",religion
13,Katherine Webb,"As you know, the South is known for its hospitality, traditions, football, pageants, and food. Football is almost like a religion here.

17,Emile Durkheim,"Man seeks to learn, and man kills himself because of the loss of cohesion in his religious society; he does not kill himself because of his learning. It is certainly not the learning he acquires that disorganizes religion; but the desire for knowledge wakens because religion becomes disorganized.","[learning, knowledge, society]",religion
18,Martin Rees,"Campaigning against religion can be socially counter-productive.

19,Amin Maalouf,I have the profoundest respect for people who behave in a generous way because of religion. But I come from a country where the misuse of religion has had catastrophic consequences.

20,Jason Isbell,"For a lot of folks who get sober, the process of getting and staying sober becomes their higher power, and it becomes a religion that sort of consumes a whole lot of them. I just don't think that that's necessary. I think that that can be a side note rather than the story of your life.","[life, power, story]",religion
21,Trick Daddy,I'm married to the street; I ain't gonna switch over. I ain't gonna go religion on nobody. I believe in God - God is for the thugs too - but the streets are in the most trouble.

23,Camille Paglia,"Christianity began as a religion of the poor and dispossessed - farmers, fishermen, Bedouin shepherds. There's a great lure to that kind of simplicity and rigor - the discipline, the call to action.","[great, discipline]",religion
24,Wole Soyinka,"Trading and religion have always been aligned together in the history of the world, and especially on the African continent.","[history, together, world]",religion
25,Huston Smith,"God has to speak to each person in their own language, in their own idioms. Take Spanish, Chinese. You can express the same thought, but to different people you have to use a different language. It's the same in religion.","[god, language, people]",religion
