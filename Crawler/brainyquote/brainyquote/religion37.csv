0,Martin Rees,I would support peaceful co-existence between religion and science because they concern different domains. Anyone who takes theology seriously knows that it's not a matter of using it to explain things that scientists are mystified by.,"[science, support, peaceful]",religion

2,Reza Aslan,"I'm interested in the origins of the religious experience, how the history of religion has evolved over the last umpteen thousand years, and where religiosity is going in the future. I think that's a topic I've been chewing on for a few years; I would love to eventually work on and produce a book out of it.","[love, work, future]",religion
3,Reza Aslan,"Mike Huckabee and indeed many of the Christian conservatives in the U.S. have far more in common with the Muslim Brotherhood than they'd like to admit, in that all of them very much want to see a role of religion in society.","[society, brotherhood]",religion
4,Reza Aslan,"Religion is never going to go away, and anyone who thinks it will doesn't understand what religion is. It is a language to describe the experience of human nature, so for as long as people struggle to describe what it means to be alive, it will be a ready-made language to express those feelings.","[nature, experience, struggle]",religion
5,Anne Graham Lotz,"I think of religion as man's attempt to reach God, and you can't do that.","[god, man, think]",religion
6,Jacob Artist,"I love Frank Ocean. I think he's so talented and his music is so great. So, I would love to do one of his songs like 'Bad Religion' or 'Pink Matter.'","[love, music, great]",religion
7,Anurag Kashyap,We need to stop objectifying our women in what we call our second religion... Our films. And our TV shows.,"[women, stop, need]",religion
8,Kirk Douglas,"I studied Judaism a lot. I studied religion in general, and I have never imposed my Judaism on my kids. They are what they want to be. I think... you must care for others. That's the correct religion, I think.","[care, want, think]",religion
9,Dan Brown,"The power that religion has is that you think nothing is random: If there's a tragedy in my life, that's God testing me or sending me a message.","[life, god, power]",religion
10,Monica Bellucci,"I come from a Catholic religion, but I'm not Catholic.","[catholic, come]",religion
11,Bill O'Reilly,Your mom was right when she told you never to discuss politics and religion because emotions run so high in those arenas. Especially religion.,"[mom, politics, she]",religion
12,Bill O'Reilly,"Atheists well understand that Christmas is the most visible display of religion in the world, and that any diminishment of it is a good thing to militant secularists.","[christmas, good, world]",religion
13,Warren Bennis,"How can we educators claim credit for understanding, let alone teaching, the 'global mind' without a single course on the impact of religion on every day life?","[life, alone, mind]",religion
14,Michael Caine,"But the whole point of the Sixties was that you had to take people as they were. If you came in with us you left your class, and colour, and religion behind, that was what the Sixties was all about.","[people, class, you]",religion
15,Dick Cavett,"I have never been converted to or even had much interest in spiritualism, occultism, Swedenborgianism or any particular religion. And I never, except occasionally for a laugh, visit the quacks who call themselves psychics.","[laugh, interest, themselves]",religion
16,Huston Smith,No one in human history has given as much thought to the interweaving of altered states of consciousness and religion as I have.,"[history, thought]",religion
17,Chuck Palahniuk,"Once religion has been dismissed by primarily an intellectual class of people, we lose the really useful social functions of religion... What replaces it might be worse than what we throw away.","[people, intellectual, class]",religion
18,Nick Love,"This sounds really hokey, but I think Buddhism is the only religion that is genuinely peaceful, so I'd try to promote it in a contemporary society.","[society, peaceful, think]",religion
19,Stanley B. Prusiner,"From the point of view of many scientists, gods represent an explanation for the unknown. Scientists are focused on trying to understand the unknown, so there is a fundamental conflict. That said, some scientists find religion useful and perhaps even fulfilling.","[conflict, trying, unknown]",religion
20,Paul Watson,"I don't have a religion, but I respect them.","[respect, them]",religion
21,Martin Rees,"The scientists who attack mainstream religion, rather than striving for peaceful coexistence with it, damage science, and also weaken the fight against fundamentalism.","[science, fight, peaceful]",religion
22,William T. Vollmann,I don't subscribe to organised religion. I've travelled enough to see that adherents of organised religion often attack adherents of other religions.,"[see, religions, attack]",religion
23,Dave Brat,"Religion has for too long been placed on the back burner of history, when it may be one of the driving forces in history.","[history, driving, long]",religion
24,Paul Bloom,Any simple claim that you need religion to be good is flat wrong.,"[good, simple, you]",religion
25,Hugh Jackman,My father is very Jean Valjean. He's what I would call a great example of a religious person. He is a deeply thoughtful man whose religion is in his deeds way more than anything else. It's not talked about that much.,"[father, great, man]",religion
