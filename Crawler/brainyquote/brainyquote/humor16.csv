0,Nina Dobrev,"You either have chemistry or you don't, but a lot of what attracts me is a guy's mind and humor and talent. I need to get to know all those things before I fall for someone.","[mind, talent, me]",humor
1,Katharine Isabelle,"I think you have to have a sense of humor about every movie that you're doing.

2,Lynn Shelton,"Although humor is present in every one of my films, it has always been used as a way to make the darker, heavier stuff in my stories more palatable. I never set out to make 'Humpday' a comedy.","[present, way, comedy]",humor
3,Charlyne Yi,My humor isn't meant to be mean or hurt anyone. But it's to make them uncomfortable and laugh. I like making people feel a different range of emotions. I like to make people a bit confused.,"[people, laugh, hurt]",humor
4,Molly Harper,"I was that weird kid that checked out all of the non-fiction paranormal studies books from the library.

9,Jason Mraz,"In Buddhism, they say attachment to anything only leads to suffering. So when we laugh, it's our way of saying, 'I'm unattached to that.' You're tickled by it, it makes your lobes do something on their own. So humor is very important to me. I always take that to the stage first.","[suffering, me, laugh]",humor

21,Rob Thomas,Reading 'Youth in Revolt' might have ruined my career because suddenly I wanted to abandon all the emotional truth of something and just go out far on a literary limb with completely implausible things that relied completely on voice and humor. And what saved me is realizing that I couldn't do that very well.,"[truth, youth, reading]",humor
