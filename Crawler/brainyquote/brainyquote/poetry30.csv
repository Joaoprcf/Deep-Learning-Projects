0,Billy Collins,"Poetry is my cheap means of transportation. By the end of the poem the reader should be in a different place from where he started. I would like him to be slightly disoriented at the end, like I drove him outside of town at night and dropped him off in a cornfield.","[end, night, transportation]",poetry
1,Billy Collins,"I'm pretty much all for poetry in public places - poetry on buses, poetry on subways, on billboards, on cereal boxes.","[pretty, places, much]",poetry
2,Billy Collins,Poetry can do a lot of things to people. I mean it can improve your imagination. It can take you to new places. It can give you this incredible form of verbal pleasure.,"[imagination, people, you]",poetry
3,Billy Collins,"I think if a poet wanted to lead, he or she would want the message to be unequivocally clear and free of ambiguity. Whereas poetry is actually the home of ambiguity, ambivalence and uncertainty.","[home, free, uncertainty]",poetry
4,Billy Collins,"We love, you know, children love the ingredients of poetry. And then they go into this tunnel that we call adolescence, and when they come out of it, they hate poetry.","[love, children, hate]",poetry
5,Billy Collins,"I have my Poetry 180 project, which I've made my main project. We encourage high schools, because that's really where, for most people, poetry dies off and gets buried under other adolescent pursuits.","[people, project, high]",poetry
6,Billy Collins,I don't think anybody reads a book of poetry front to back. Editors and reviewers only. I don't think anybody else does.,"[book, think, back]",poetry
7,Billy Collins,"I'm a great believer in poetry out of the classroom, in public places, on subways, trains, on cocktail napkins. I'd rather have my poems on the subway than around the seminar table at an MFA program.","[great, cocktail, classroom]",poetry
8,Billy Collins,"I'm happy to stick with my persona. There are themes of love lost and love regained, but the main themes of all poems are basically love and death, and that seems to be the message of poetry.","[love, death, happy]",poetry
9,Billy Collins,"I know my voice has a limited range of motion; I don't write dramatic monologues and pretend to be other people. But so far, my voice is broad enough to accommodate most of what I want to put into my poetry. I like my persona; I often wish I were him and not me.","[people, voice, me]",poetry
10,Billy Collins,"One of the disadvantages of poetry over popular music is that if you write a pop song, it naturally gets into people's heads as they listen in the car. You don't have to memorize a Paul Simon song; it's just in your head, and you can sing along. With a poem, you have to will yourself to memorize it.","[music, car, yourself]",poetry
11,Billy Collins,"When I became poet laureate, I was in a slightly uncomfortable position because I think a lot of poetry isn't worth reading.","[reading, think]",poetry
12,Billy Collins,"For most Americans, poetry plays no role in their everyday lives. But also for most Americans, contemporary painting or jazz or sculpture play no role either. I'm not saying poetry is singled out as a special thing to ignore.","[painting, jazz, special]",poetry
13,Billy Collins,"People think of poetry as a school subject... Poetry is very frustrating to students because they don't have a taste for ambiguity, for one thing. That gives them a poetry hangover.","[school, people, think]",poetry
14,Billy Collins,My persona is less miserable than a lot of contemporary poetry speakers are.,"[miserable, less, than]",poetry
15,Billy Collins,"I'm all for poetry catching up with technology, and just as there are iTunes, I think we should have iPoems. I mean, people should be able to walk around with their earbuds in and listening to poems on their iPod.","[technology, listening]",poetry
16,Billy Collins,"I find a lot of poetry very disappointing, but I do have poets that I go back to. One book of poetry that I'd like to mention is 'The Exchange' by Sophie Cabot Black. Her poems are difficult without being too difficult.","[book, black, find]",poetry
17,Billy Collins,"In the long revolt against inherited forms that has by now become the narrative of 20th-century poetry in English, no poet was more flamboyant or more recognizable in his iconoclasm than Cummings.","[long, now, against]",poetry
18,Billy Collins,Some honor Cummings as the granddaddy of all American innovators in poetry and ascribe to him a diverse progeny that includes virtually any poet who considers the page a field and allows silence to be part of poetry's expressiveness.,"[silence, honor, american]",poetry
19,Felix Dennis,You don't have to live in a garage to write great poetry.,"[great, live, you]",poetry
20,Felix Dennis,"I want to prove that if you write in strict meter and rhyme about subjects people care about, they will buy poetry.","[people, care, want]",poetry
21,Felix Dennis,I am absolutely convinced that my life was redeemed by poetry.,"[life, i am, my life]",poetry
22,Felix Dennis,"No poetry that I'm aware of, however bad or glorious, has ever left somebody a worse person than they were before they read it.","[bad, person, left]",poetry
23,Felix Dennis,"With a poetry book I can send 100 copies out to reviewers and other people, and even do it in advance and get their response. It's difficult with iPad: how do you send it out for free, and how do you even disseminate it before it goes into their store?","[book, people, free]",poetry
24,Felix Dennis,"Poetry is one of the oldest of all art forms, and one of its powers for shamans and tribal leaders was the mnemonic.","[art, leaders, oldest]",poetry
25,J. Michael Straczynski,"I've written for every medium except poetry, at which I suck.","[every, which, medium]",poetry
