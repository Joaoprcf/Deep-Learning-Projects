8,Josh Hartnett,If everything is going well in my life then I start to read the papers more and I start to worry about everything I can't deal with. They say wisdom is knowing what you can fix and what you can't change. I'm very unwise.,"[life, change, my life]",wisdom

13,Pawel Pawlikowski,"For me, good films and good books are irreducible to a lesson. You can't just kind of translate them into one statement. On the contrary, the more you do that, the less wisdom in art there is.","[art, good, me]",wisdom
