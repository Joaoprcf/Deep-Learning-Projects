0,Greg Lynn,"What's interesting about architects is, we always have tried to justify beauty by looking to nature, and arguably, beautiful architecture has always been looking at a model of nature.","[nature, beauty, beautiful]",architecture
1,Greg Lynn,"To go back to architecture, what's organic about architecture as a field, unlike product design, is this whole issue of holism and of monumentality is really our realm. Like, we have to design things which are coherent as a single object, but also break down into small rooms and have an identity of both the big scale and the small scale.","[design, small, identity]",architecture
2,Cesar Pelli,"When I started designing in school, I discovered that I had a knack for it. I fell completely in love with architecture, and I remain in love with it.","[love, school, remain]",architecture

4,Cesar Pelli,Architecture adds dimensions to my life that would be impossible to acquire if I retired. The beautiful thing about architecture is that every project is brand new. I am forced to renew myself with every project. Isn't that wonderful?,"[life, myself, beautiful]",architecture

6,Marco Brambilla,"I think in America there's this free flow between fashion, art, architecture, music and design. In Europe, it's more segregated between those different disciplines, I think.","[music, art, design]",architecture
7,Donald Bren,"Newport Center has become a Mediterranean town. The climate here is the same as the Mediterranean's, and so is the architecture. This center exudes a radiance, an energy. It will become a special way of life for everyone.","[life, energy, way]",architecture
8,Max Walker,"About 1998, when 'Wide World of Sports' and the 'Footy Show' came to an end for me, I couldn't type. When I started architecture, it was a very aesthetic, creative, an almost art process, where lettering and thick line were how you expressed yourself on the paper.","[art, sports, end]",architecture
9,Hannah Ware,"I am a failed architect, if I'm honest. I got a degree in art history and was about to get another degree, in architecture, but realized I would be terrible at building things because I've got really bad spatial awareness.","[art, history, i am]",architecture
10,Dieter Rams,There is a lot of bad architecture. What we need more is to look at how our landscape should look in the next decades.,"[look, landscape, bad]",architecture

17,Antoine Predock,A building that has great environmental responsibility is a political animal in a way because it becomes promotional of a cause. I think that kind of advocacy through architecture is really good.,"[good, environmental, great]",architecture
18,Ron Eglash,"My assumption was that all indigenous architecture would be more fractal. My reasoning was that all indigenous architecture tends to be organized from the bottom up. As it turns out, though, my reasoning was wrong.","[wrong, bottom, organized]",architecture
19,David Josiah Brewer,"Oratory is the masterful art. Poetry, painting, music, sculpture, architecture please, thrill, inspire - but oratory rules.

23,Steven Holl,Princeton University's campus environment presents unique challenges and opportunities for architecture to act as a social condenser.,"[opportunities, environment]",architecture
