11,Masashi Kishimoto,"I like the way Quentin Tarantino creates a scene using a series of close-ups or showing very cool images of a person or people walking on some ordinary street in slow motion.

12,Gerard Way,"I had a couple of really cool friends when I was a kid, and we'd find cool music and movies and show them to each other.
