1,Arnaud Desplechin,"Each time I'm starting to work on a film, even if I love to settle the plot in the real world, I start to think about the plot as a fairy tale, or a dream, or a nightmare...

4,Joseph Prince,"It is the truth of grace and not of the law that brings you true freedom. The truth of the law only binds you.

9,Jamie Johnson,"I think people who don't work don't really have interesting and meaningful lives. More than anything, it hurts them.

Everyone takes pride in the work they do.","[work, pride, people]",truth

16,William Kent Krueger,"Write because you love the work, not because of what might come from it. The journey is the purpose. Very Zen-like, I know, but honest to God it's the truth. And I have never had to deal with writer's block. Knock on wood.","[love, work, journey]",truth

18,Hans Jonas,"The simple truth of our finiteness is that we could, by whatever means, go on interminably only at the price of either losing the past and, therewith, our identity, or living only in the past and therefore without a real present. We cannot seriously wish either and thus not a physical enduring at that price.","[past, simple, losing]",truth
