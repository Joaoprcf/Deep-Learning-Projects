6,Ray Comfort,"Every song has a composer, every book has an author, every car has a maker, every painting has a painter, and every building has a builder.

7,Simon Baker,"Well, capitalism is going to grow and grow. The nature of it is that the guy who has the most poker chips on the table has more leverage than everyone else.

8,Theo James,"People say that New Yorkers aren't friendly, but I think they're more friendly than Londoners. Here there is a front-footed nature of Americans.

15,Vilayanur S. Ramachandran,People often ask how I got interested in the brain; my rhetorical answer is: 'How can anyone NOT be interested in it?' Everything you call 'human nature' and consciousness arises from it.,"[brain, people, human nature]",nature
16,Yehuda Berg,"Unfortunately, it is human nature for us to only learn and grow from a place of emptiness. It's hard to learn when we are winning and on top of the world.","[winning, world, learn]",nature

24,Paul Stamets,"Today, reishi stands out as one the most valuable of all polypore mushrooms in nature for the benefit of our health. Many naturopaths and doctors prefer organically-grown reishi from pristine environments because they are more pure.","[health, today, most]",nature
