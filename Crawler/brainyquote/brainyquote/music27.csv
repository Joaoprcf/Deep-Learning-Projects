0,Trent Reznor,"I'm a lot less precious than I used to be about putting things out, for better or for worse. The result of a public that has a very high consumption rate and turnover rate is people listen to more music but spend less time with individual bits of music.","[time, people, better]",music
1,Trent Reznor,I'd rather not get into what I'm talking about lyrically. I think it's impossible not to demystify a song when saying what it's about. Music and art can be damaged severely by too much information; I say that as somebody that has participated in that.,"[art, information, impossible]",music
2,Juliana Hatfield,"For a long time, music was hope. Now it seems music isn't enough to make me happy. It used to be that's all I needed to keep going. Now I need other things to take up the other parts of my life.","[life, time, hope]",music
3,Dolly Parton,"Kitty Wells was the first and only Queen of Country Music, no matter what they call the rest of us.

In addition to being a wonderful asset to country music, she was a wonderful woman.","[business, great, woman]",music
4,Shelley Hennig,"I'm actually loving the soundtrack to 'The Secret Circle' that our music supervisor Liza Richardson puts together, like Washed Out and Cults, but my favorite band is Bootstraps.","[together, circle, band]",music
5,Jimi Hendrix,Music is my religion.,[religion],music
6,Charlie Haden,"The bass, no matter what kind of music you're playing, it just enhances the sound and makes everything sound more beautiful and full. When the bass stops, the bottom kind of drops out of everything.","[beautiful, matter, you]",music
7,Sun Ra,Today's symphonic music is sponsored by the upper structures of society.,"[today, society, structures]",music
8,Lianne La Havas,I love the music of Lauryn Hill and Erykah Badu and more recently the music of Laura Marling. All these women share a strength and a wisdom in their voices and music that really makes me want to make music and sing.,"[love, strength, wisdom]",music
9,George Benson,"We don't live in a jazz world, unfortunately. I think if I had lived in a jazz world, I would have done OK. I'm not sure I would have done great. I'm a lover of jazz music, so I would have been happy, don't get me wrong. I go to jazz concerts like the biggest jazz fan in world. The drag is that I don't play jazz for a living.","[happy, great, world]",music
10,Edgar Winter,"I think The Doors are one of the classic groups, and I think we're all tempted to feel like the time in which we grew up was somehow special, but I really do believe that there were two golden eras in music: The Forties and Fifties of big band, jazz and swing, and the Sixties and Seventies of rock. To me, they're really unparalleled.","[time, believe, me]",music
11,Jamie Foxx,"In our music, in our everyday life, there are so many negative things. Why not have something positive and stamp it with blackness?","[life, positive, negative]",music

15,Jenni Rivera,"Mexican music runs through my veins. I loved it. Growing up, my father didn't allow us to listen to English music at home. That's all I heard. I had no choice.","[home, father, growing up]",music
16,Ha-Joon Chang,"Imagine if all those kings and dukes hadn't commissioned those crazy cathedrals, paintings and music... we'd still be living in sticks and mud. Because none of those things made any economic sense. Human beings' capacity to 'waste time' is a miracle - but that's exactly what art is for.","[time, art, crazy]",music
17,David Bowie,"Searching for music is like searching for God. They're very similar. There's an effort to reclaim the unmentionable, the unsayable, the unseeable, the unspeakable, all those things, comes into being a composer and to writing music and to searching for notes and pieces of musical information that don't exist.","[god, effort, writing]",music

21,Katherine Jenkins,I have such happy memories of performing in a choir and I don't think I'd have got where I am today without all that experience. So my advice to young singers is to either join your school or church's choir or find one in your local area. Choral music at any level teaches you so much about musicianship and blending your voice.,"[experience, memories, happy]",music
22,Trent Reznor,"To me, rock music was never meant to be safe. I think there needs to be an element of intrigue, mystery, subversiveness. Your parents should hate it.","[hate, parents, me]",music
23,Ozzy Osbourne,Rock music is not meant to be perfect.,"[perfect, rock, meant to be]",music
24,Chelsea Leyland,The best thing about being a DJ is making people happy. There is nothing like seeing people get up from a table to dance or the expression on their face when they hear a song they love. I also love to educate people on music they have never heard.,"[love, best, happy]",music
25,Eddie Van Halen,"It's funny, when bands or younger musicians ask me: 'So, what does it take to make it?' Well, first explain to me what you mean by 'making it': Do you want to be a rock star or do you want music to be your livelihood?","[funny, musicians, me]",music
