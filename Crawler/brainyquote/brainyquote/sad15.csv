0,Carolina Herrera,"I love books; my suitcases are always full of them. Books and shoes. I read when I am sad, when I am happy, when I am nervous. My favourite British author is Jane Austen, and my favourite American one is John O'Hara.","[love, happy, i am]",sad
1,Roger Rosenblatt,"If the sad truth be known, writers, being the misfits we are, probably ought not to belong to families in the first place. We simply are too self-interested, though we may excuse the flaw by calling it 'focused.'","[truth, place, may]",sad
2,Manny Farber,"'Sunset Boulevard' - the story of Hollywood movies draped on a depressing sex affair - is an uncompromising study of American decadence displaying a sad, worn, methodical beauty few films have had since the late twenties.","[beauty, sunset, american]",sad
3,Amanda Plummer,"I like devilish, thorny, dirty, mean roles, muck and mire, unbelievably sad, unbelievably happy, burdened. Inner conflict - that's where drama is.","[happy, conflict, drama]",sad
4,Skylar Grey,"I think, honestly, that a lot of people think I'm sad and dark all the time, because of the music I have made. But there's a huge part of my personality that's really energetic, outgoing and goofy.","[music, time, personality]",sad
5,Martin Rees,"Scientists habitually moan that the public doesn't understand them. But they complain too much: public ignorance isn't peculiar to science. It's sad if some citizens can't tell a proton from a protein. But it's equally sad if they're ignorant of their nation's history, can't speak a second language, or can't find Venezuela or Syria on a map.","[history, science, ignorance]",sad
6,Madeline Kahn,"From inside where I live, I feel like I just perceive events in a certain rational way. I often find it sad or poignant, and it may not make me laugh a bit. But I don't mind inventing a portrait that allows others to laugh if that's what they want to do.","[mind, me, laugh]",sad
7,Olivia Wilde,"Fear of carbs, of gluten, of everything - we've distanced ourselves from the beauty of food, the art of it. It makes me sad when people say, 'Oh, I don't eat gluten. I don't eat cheese. I don't eat this. So I eat cardboard.'","[beauty, art, food]",sad
8,Brian Bonsall,"I don't think I could compare myself to Macaulay Culkin, because we're pretty much two different kinds of actors. He's done a lot of comedy. He does mostly just comedy like 'Uncle Buck' and 'Home Alone' and 'Home Alone 2.' And I've done a lot of different stuff, like sad movies, like the movie about the kid with AIDS.","[home, alone, myself]",sad
9,Matt Groening,"When DVDs finally disappear, I'm going to be sad. I'll miss the commentaries.","[going, disappear, miss]",sad
10,Mary J. Blige,"I just want fans to walk away knowing that no matter what's going on, no matter how happy you are, no matter how sad you are, we did it. We're strong in this. We've come a long way, and life is not just one thing.","[life, happy, strong]",sad
11,Janet Jackson,"People tend to put entertainers on pedestals. We're human beings, just like you. You may see us smiling, and whether we have money or not, we still have bills to pay, we still have our stresses. I think a lot of people want to focus on others' shortcomings to make themselves feel better. And it's a very sad thing.","[money, focus, people]",sad
12,Kapil Dev,"I feel that World Cup cricket should be played like football in which all the 160 countries take part. If only a handful of countries are going to keep on playing in the World Cup without making the game popular, I will be a sad man.","[football, man, world]",sad
13,Martin Rees,"It would be sad if the expertise built up during the 40 years of the U.S. and Russian manned programmes were allowed to dissipate. But abandoning the shuttle, and committing to new launch vehicles and propulsion systems, is actually a prerequisite for a vibrant manned programme.","[launch, new, expertise]",sad
14,Ban Ki-moon,"It is a sad but undeniable reality that people have died in the line of duty since the earliest days of the United Nations. The first was Ole Bakke, a Norwegian member of the United Nations guard detachment, shot and killed in Palestine in 1948. The toll since then has included colleagues at all levels.","[people, reality, colleagues]",sad
15,Gillian Jacobs,"I think that there are a lot of really beautiful Christmas carols, and then sometimes there are horrible renditions of them that are played to death in malls that make me sad. I try to avoid stores where they're playing bad versions of Christmas songs on repeat.","[christmas, death, beautiful]",sad
16,Andrew Ross Sorkin,"Corporate tax reform is nice in theory but tough in practice. It most likely requires lower tax rates and the closing of loopholes, which many companies are sure to fight. And whatever new, lower tax rate is determined, there will probably be another country willing to lower its rate further, creating a sad race to zero.","[fight, practice, tough]",sad
17,Andie MacDowell,"For me, it's sad to say, but I would probably have a spiritual marriage but not a legal marriage, because I think so much about marriage starts to become about finances. It has nothing to do with God or feelings or the romantic side of marriage. It's about who owns what, who gets what? So what's the point?","[marriage, god, romantic]",sad
18,Sanjay Dutt,"I think the best thing about my short-lived political career was that I saw the interiors of Bihar and UP. That is the real India, and, being an Indian, it was really sad to see our own people living in such dismal conditions. It was a real eye-opener.","[best, political, people]",sad
19,Pattie Boyd,"I think men are mainly unfaithful because as they get older, they feel the urge to prove to themselves that they are still attractive. They need proof from outside the marriage. It's really sad. It's all about them. It's not about their wives at all.","[marriage, men, think]",sad
20,Shah Rukh Khan,"You know, I think we Indians are afraid to show and celebrate our happiness, lest things change around. But I feel that it's okay to be sad and okay to show when you are happy.","[happiness, change, happy]",sad
21,Rainn Wilson,"I know what I look like - a weird, sad clown puppet. I'm fine with that.","[know, weird, look]",sad
22,Anne Sullivan,We all like stories that make us cry. It's so nice to feel sad when you've nothing in particular to feel sad about.,"[nothing, nice, you]",sad
23,Craig Kilborn,"President Bush spent last night calling world leaders to support the war with Iraq and it is sad when the most powerful man on earth is yelling, 'I know you're there, pick up, pick up.","[war, support, man]",sad
24,Joan Allen,"Acting gave me the opportunity to do outrageous things. It allowed me to be sad, happy, angry and lustful, even if it was just vicariously.","[happy, opportunity, me]",sad
25,Bob Livingston,I don't wanta do any Blues or any sad songs.,"[blues, songs, sad songs]",sad
