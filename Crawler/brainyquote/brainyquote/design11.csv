4,Rudy Giuliani,There is no city in America that has reduced crime as much as we have in the last three years. This is not the product of accident. This is the product of design.,"[america, city, crime]",design

7,Ty Pennington,Design can change how you look at yourself.,"[change, yourself, look]",design
8,Carroll Shelby,"I don't design cars. I'm not a designer.

I don't do anything.","[work, together, end]",design
9,Dayo Okeniyi,"I decided to go to school for advertising and graphic design. That was what I was gonna do but acting is that thing, it's like a splinter in your mind and you can't get rid of it. So I decided to move to L.A. a few years ago and it just snowballed into this thing called 'The Hunger Games.'","[school, mind, advertising]",design

11,Peter Eisenman,Architects design houses. I live in a home.,"[home, live, houses]",design
12,Zaha Hadid,"I've always thought that design can have equal importance to the idea of internal architecture.

13,Paul Rand,"To design is much more than simply to assemble, to order, or even to edit: it is to add value and meaning, to illuminate, to simplify, to clarify, to modify, to dignify, to dramatize, to persuade, and perhaps even to amuse. To design is to transform prose into poetry.","[poetry, value, meaning]",design
14,Cindy Gallop,"When we launched If WeRanTheWorld, I said to my team, I want us to innovate in every aspect of how we design and operate this as a business venture, as much as the web platform itself - because I want us to design our own startup around the working lives that we would all like to live.

18,Renzo Piano,"When you design a building, you start from a general philosophy, and you come down, and you start from detail and come up. Only the theoretical architect believes that you can make the concept and then sometime, somebody will come to build it.","[philosophy, building, start]",design
19,Diane von Furstenberg,"The most important relationship you have in life is the one you have with yourself. And then after that, I'd say once you have that, it may be hard work, but you can actually design your life.","[life, work, relationship]",design
20,David A. Bednar,"By divine design, men and women are intended to progress together toward perfection and a fulness of glory.

21,Ferdinand Porsche,"Design must be functional, and functionality must be translated into visual aesthetics without any reliance on gimmicks that have to be explained.","[visual, without, explained]",design

23,Nate Berkus,"Design, to me, is part psychology, part sociology, and part magic. A good decorator should know what's going on in someone's marriage and how their kids are doing in school.","[marriage, good, school]",design
24,David Carson,"I'm a big believer in the emotion of design, and the message that's sent before somebody begins to read, before they get the rest of the information; what is the emotional response they get to the product, to the story, to the painting - whatever it is.","[information, painting, story]",design
25,David Carson,"For some reason I have a visual intuition that allows me to design things in an interesting way, and I don't know where that came from. Because I don't have this formal training, I seem to drift in a different direction.","[training, me, know]",design
