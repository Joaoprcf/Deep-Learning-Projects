0,Dean Kamen,Nobody expects that just because they've made computers better they're going to give them to you free.,"[free, better, you]",computers
1,John Hawkes,"The only thing I do on a computer is play Texas Hold 'Em, really. Obviously my cell phone is a computer. My car is a computer. I'm on computers every day without actively seeking them out.","[car, day, cell phone]",computers
2,Margaret Heffernan,"Everywhere I look, there are ads marking Mother's Day. Mostly they conform to stereotype: flowers, jewelry, perfume. Not a lot of books. Not many computers. Few tools. Little that's useful.","[mother, flowers, day]",computers
3,Tyler Cowen,"We're seeing an enormous amount of global upward mobility that's quite rapid and quite sudden, and undiscovered individuals have a chance - using the Internet, using computers - to prove themselves very quickly. So I think the mobility story will be a quite complicated one.","[internet, chance, story]",computers
4,Tyler Cowen,"I think a lot of people will be liberated from a lot of oppressive manufacturing jobs, or a lot of service jobs, because they'll be done by computers. There'll be the world's best education available online and free.","[education, best, service]",computers
5,Tyler Cowen,"When humans team up with computers to play chess, the humans who do best are not necessarily the strongest players. They're the ones who are modest and who know when to listen to the computer. Often, what the human adds is knowledge of when the computer needs to look more deeply.","[best, knowledge, team]",computers
6,Tyler Cowen,"There's so much free material on the Internet you can learn from, and some people are pure self-starters: they pick up computers and teach themselves everything. Certainly there are millions of people like that. But at the same time, I think it's a pretty small percentage of the population.","[time, small, internet]",computers
7,Steve Coogan,I am of the very last generation who didn't have computers at school. As we grow old we'll become something of an aberration.,"[school, i am, generation]",computers
8,Jean Rostand,Think? Why think! We have computers to do that for us.,"[think, why, us]",computers
9,Elizabeth McCracken,"For about half an hour in mid-1992, I knew as much as any layperson about the pleasures of remote access of other people's computers.","[people, much, half]",computers
10,Bill Maris,"As computer intelligence gets better, what will be possible when we interface our brains with computers? It might sound scary, but early evidence suggests otherwise: interfacing brains with machines can be helpful in treating traumatic brain injury, repairing spinal cord damage, and countless other applications.","[intelligence, brain, better]",computers
11,Elmore Leonard,"I can write anywhere. But I don't use a computer, and I could never write on a laptop. I hate the sound of computers; it's too dull, like it's not doing anything for you.","[hate, doing, you]",computers
12,Jack White,"That's what happens nowadays with people working on computers. They can so easily fix things with their mouse and take out all the, 'Oh, somebody coughed in the background; we need to take that out' - or somebody hit a bad note. Those are all the best moments.","[best, people, moments]",computers
13,Paul Di Filippo,It was not until the appearance of cyberpunk in the 1980s that SF began to grapple in a broadly meaningful way with the reality of computers as something other than giant mainframes tended by crewcut IBM nerds.,"[reality, meaningful]",computers
14,Jaron Lanier,"Musicians and journalists are the canaries in the coalmine, but, eventually, as computers get more and more powerful, it will kill off all middle-class professions.","[musicians, powerful, will]",computers
15,Elizabeth Debicki,Charlestoning is hard. People were fit in the '20s to be able to do that. I guess they didn't sit in front of their computers all day.,"[day, people, sit]",computers
16,Sundar Pichai,"There's an evolution from, today we tell computers to do stuff for us, to where computers can actually do stuff for us. For example, if I go and pick up my kids, it would be good for my car to be aware that my kids have entered the car and change the music to something that's appropriate for them.","[change, music, good]",computers
17,Mitchell Baker,"We carry around computers in our pockets. Many people barely use them as phones. We use them as computers. If you think about the future, when you're traveling around, it's great to have a lightweight, small form factor.","[future, great, small]",computers
18,Richard Stallman,"When I launched the development of the GNU system, I explicitly said the purpose of developing this system is so we can use our computers and have freedom, thus if you use some other free system instead but you have freedom, then it's a success. It's not popularity for our code but it's success for our goal.","[success, freedom, goal]",computers
19,Richard Stallman,"A smartphone is a computer - it's not built using a computer - the job it does is the job of being a computer. So, everything we say about computers, that the software you run should be free - you should insist on that - applies to smart phones just the same. And likewise to those tablets.","[smart, job, free]",computers
20,Anthony Browne,"I'm impressed by the way some illustrators develop their images on computers, but it's too late for me to start, and I'm still in love with paper and paint and pencils.","[love, me, late]",computers
21,Busy Philipps,I know so many people who actually just watch television on their computers now and don't even really watch their TV anymore.,"[people, know, television]",computers
22,Eddie Trunk,"I truly believe that you have to bring more content to the table to survive in radio than saying, 'There was AC/DC, and here's Journey,' because computers can do that.","[journey, believe, content]",computers
23,Ronald Kessler,"Whatever they do, criminals and non-criminals act in particular ways. Some writers, for instance, use computers, others pen and paper. Some write in the morning, some at night. Each writer has a distinct style, with variations in grammar, sentence structure, and voice.","[morning, style, night]",computers
24,Joshua Cohen,"Without computers, in the 17th century, we could classify the entire animal kingdom... there was this idea of the speciation, right? And now, all a search engine is is essentially the mathematical speciation of ideas - and these things really derive from the way that language is used and the way words relate.","[language, words, ideas]",computers
25,Andrew Rosenthal,"When I heard the news that Steve Jobs had died, my mind flashed back to 1985, when I began my love affair with computers. I was stationed in Moscow for The Associated Press, and I ordered an Apple IIc - by Telex - from a department store in Helsinki, Finland. They express-shipped it to me, a month later, by train.","[love, mind, me]",computers
