1,John Cusack,"I always liked it when people go back in time to discover things about themselves, like with 'A Christmas Carol' and you're getting a tour of your life by the ghosts of Christmas past, present and future.","[life, time, future]",christmas
2,Mary Berry,"Making your Christmas cake in September is perfect, as too fresh a cake crumbles when cut.","[cake, perfect, september]",christmas
3,Mary Berry,"I am a bit of a mother hen at Christmas! I always prepare in advance. It is the only way; otherwise, it can be really daunting.","[mother, i am, way]",christmas
4,Mary Berry,"My son is a tree surgeon and gets me a lovely tree. I like to put it up early, as I can't wait for Christmas. We dress it with decorations that have been in the family for years.","[family, tree, son]",christmas
5,Chevy Chase,"Comparing 'Christmas Vacation' to 'It's A Wonderful Life' is the silliest thing. That film starred the greatest movie actor of all time, and the idea that our movie could ever be connected in some fashion to something so brilliant and beautiful always made feel like, 'That's all they had to write about?'","[life, time, beautiful]",christmas
6,Chevy Chase,Frank Capra's grandson was a second Assistant Director on 'Christmas Vacation.',"[vacation, grandson, director]",christmas
7,Michael Dirda,"Back in the 1950s and '60s, J. M. Barrie's 'Peter Pan' - starring Mary Martin and Cyril Ritchard - was regularly aired on network television during the Christmas season. I must have seen it four or five times and remember, in particular, Ritchard's gloriously camp interpretation of Captain Hook.","[season, remember, television]",christmas
8,Michael Dirda,My urge at Christmas time or Hanukkah-time or Kwanzaa-time is that people go to bookstores: that they walk around bookstores and look at the shelves. Go to look for authors that they've loved in the past and see what else those authors have written.,"[time, past, people]",christmas
9,Michael Dirda,It's a sad commentary on our time - to use a phrase much favored by my late father - that people increasingly celebrate Christmas Day by going to the movies.,"[time, father, sad]",christmas
10,Michael Dirda,"Deep in my cortex, the year is divided into reading seasons. The period from mid-October to Christmas, for instance, is 'ghost story' time, while Jane Austen and P. G. Wodehouse pretty much own April and May.","[time, deep, reading]",christmas
11,Michael Dirda,Neither my mom nor my dad ever bought me any comic books. Certainly not for Christmas. I suspect that doing so would have violated the Parents' Code.,"[mom, dad, parents]",christmas
12,Julie Burchill,"It may be a cliche, but it's true - the build-up to Christmas is so much more pleasurable than the actual day itself.","[day, true, may]",christmas
13,Julie Burchill,"One Christmas build-up tradition, however, has totally bypassed me - that of going up to town and 'doing a show.'","[me, doing, tradition]",christmas
14,David Lynch,"I love Christmas tree bulbs, and I started putting them in my paintings. You've got to plug this painting in, and it's got a rig in the back, so that each one can be replaced if it burns out.","[love, tree, painting]",christmas

17,Terry Teachout,"Most of us remember Nat King Cole as a vocalist. His warm, grainy baritone is still so closely identified with such familiar ballads as 'Stardust' and 'The Christmas Song' that it's hard to imagine anyone else performing them.","[king, warm, remember]",christmas
18,Jay Parini,"Christmas is a story that has both religious and pagan origins, and to ignore its power is to ignore the power of myth - those symbols and legends that help us to ground our lives.","[power, help, legends]",christmas
19,Jay Parini,"The whole Christmas story was probably a later addition to the gospel narratives, presented only by the authors of Matthew and Luke. Mark and John seem never to have heard of the manger in Bethlehem, the Massacre of the Innocents, the hovering star, the three wise men, and so forth.","[wise, men, story]",christmas
20,Jay Parini,"Christmas is, for those who wish to follow the way of Jesus, an invitation to accept into our comfortable and safe lives those who come to us from far away, who seem ragged, marginal, in transition.","[transition, wish, accept]",christmas
21,John Ridley,"I like animals. I like people who like animals. I hate people who love animals to the point they lose their sense of reason. I'm talking the 'my computer wallpaper is my dog,' 'I hang a Christmas stocking for my cat' crowd.","[love, dog, hate]",christmas
22,James Lankford,"The joy of Christmas causes hundreds of radio stations around the country to play Christmas music all day, and people will exchange millions of gifts to remember the first gift of Christmas, the infant Jesus.","[music, joy, gift]",christmas
23,James Lankford,"As we see thousands of public and private Christmas trees and nativity displays around the country, they remind us again of the powerful American value built into our Constitution: our freedom of religion.","[freedom, religion]",christmas

25,Jay Samit,"Every product you have ever loved was a compromise from the ideal vision of its creators to the realities of shipping on time, on budget, and on price point. Anyone who has ever manufactured a physical product that had to be on the shelves for Christmas shopping knows how painful these choices can be.","[time, vision, choices]",christmas
