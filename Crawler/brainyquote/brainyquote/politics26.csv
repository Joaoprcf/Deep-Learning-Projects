6,Denise Mina,"I was very aware of office politics because I was so baffled by them. So much so goes unsaid. No one says 'you're a cheeky so-and-so,' no one says 'you're so moody,' nobody ever confronts anyone else about anything. But I'm very crass, and I'm very confrontational, and I have a temper. I had to be hyper-vigilant in every office I worked in.","[you, office, nobody]",politics

The relationship between walking and thinking and between the mind and the body.","[life, relationship, path]",politics
12,Zygmunt Bauman,"Power, in a nutshell, is the ability to get things done, and politics is the ability to decide which things need to be done.","[power, done, need]",politics
13,Joe Green,"When all is said and done and the e-book is written about politics and the Internet, it is not going to be about the presidential election. It will be about the smaller elections in aggregate that have a huge effect on people's lives.","[election, internet, people]",politics
14,Lincoln Steffens,"Whenever anything extraordinary is done in American municipal politics, whether for good or for evil, you can trace it almost invariably to one man. The people do not do it. Neither do the 'gangs,' 'combines,' or political parties.","[good, evil, man]",politics
15,Fred Wilson,"Politics and government have been a terrible place to invest; education has been a terrible place to invest, but that is because the entrenched interests make it a terrible place to invest. The way you invest in those sectors is you go against the entrenched interests; you try and disrupt the entrenched interests, not to service them.","[education, service]",politics
16,Mark McKinnon,Hypocrisy is the scarlet letter in politics.,"[hypocrisy, letter, scarlet]",politics
17,Steven Pinker,"My politics were pretty anarchistic until 1969 when the Montreal police went on strike.

20,Steven Wright,"I like to talk about lint and coasters, the expansion of the universe and maybe McDonald's. I'm completely turned off by the idea of politics.","[universe, talk, mcdonald]",politics
21,Ewan McGregor,"I've always been really uninterested in politicians and the acts of the Houses of Parliament, or government as an idea. But I'm interested in politics in that I'm a member of the world, and I have strong feelings of right and wrong, but I can't get into the ins and outs of it.","[strong, government, world]",politics
22,Mark Leibovich,"To cover politics in Washington allows you to live in the very, very wide gap between what the actual truth is, and how people are trying to manipulate the truth.
