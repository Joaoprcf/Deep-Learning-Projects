0,Mahmoud Darwish,Poetry and beauty are always making peace. When you read something beautiful you find coexistence; it breaks walls down.,"[beauty, peace, beautiful]",poetry
1,Mahmoud Darwish,"The importance of poetry is not measured, finally, by what the poet says but by how he says it.","[measured, how, poet]",poetry
2,Paul Rand,"To design is much more than simply to assemble, to order, or even to edit: it is to add value and meaning, to illuminate, to simplify, to clarify, to modify, to dignify, to dramatize, to persuade, and perhaps even to amuse. To design is to transform prose into poetry.","[design, value, meaning]",poetry
3,Renzo Piano,"In a way I spend my entire life stealing from everything - from the past, from cities I love, from where I grew up - grabbing things, taking not only from architecture but from Italy, art, writing, poetry, music.","[life, love, music]",poetry
4,Jose Saramago,"I think the novel is not so much a literary genre, but a literary space, like a sea that is filled by many rivers. The novel receives streams of science, philosophy, poetry and contains all of these; it's not simply telling a story.","[science, sea, philosophy]",poetry
5,Earl Sweatshirt,"I think rap music is rap music. I mean, are there heavy writing aspects of it? Absolutely. In a sense, is it poetry? Yeah. I've heard that so much, growing up in a house with poetry. But I think people like to use that as a shortcut for who's good and who's not. It's like the word 'lyrical' - 'lyrical' is the worst word in the entire world.","[music, good, writing]",poetry
6,Natasha Trethewey,The experience of poetry could bring my mother back to me. Poetry offers a different kind of solace - here on earth.,"[experience, mother, me]",poetry
7,F. Sionil Jose,I am for poetry that is admired by peasant and aristocrat alike.,"[i am, alike, peasant]",poetry
8,Sarah Kay,"Spoken word poetry is the art of performance poetry. I tell people it involves creating poetry that doesn't just want to sit on paper, that something about it demands it be heard out loud or witnessed in person.","[art, people, performance]",poetry
9,Hannah Kent,"I have a deep and ongoing love of Iceland, particular the landscape, and when writing 'Burial Rites,' I was constantly trying to see whether I could distill its extraordinary and ineffable qualities into a kind of poetry.","[love, deep, writing]",poetry
10,James Fenimore Cooper,"I sometimes wish I had been educated a Catholic, in order to unite the poetry of religion with its higher principles. Are they necessarily inseparable? Is man really so much of a philosopher, that he can conceive of truth in its abstract purity, and divest life and the affections of all the aids of the imagination?","[life, truth, religion]",poetry
11,Guy Davenport,Poetry and fiction have grieved for a century now over the loss of some vitality which they think they see in a past from which we are by now irrevocably alienated.,"[past, loss, fiction]",poetry
12,Tony Buzan,"In 1971, when I was 29, I wrote my first volume of poetry. I am a poet, and I have published four books of my poems.","[i am, four, first]",poetry
13,Theresa Breslin,"When I was young, I read everything I could lay my hands on, but the Scots in my storybooks spent their time fighting glorious battles, rowing across lochs, or escaping over moors of purple heather. Even those Scots were hard to find. For at school, we recited poetry according to the set texts the teachers taught us.","[time, school, hands]",poetry
14,Louis MacNeice,"For this reason poets and artists developed the doctrine of Art for Art's Sake. The community did not appear to need them, so, tit for tat, they did not need the community. This being granted, it was no longer necessary or even desirable to make one's poetry either intelligible or sympathetic to the community.","[art, community, reason]",poetry
15,Marcel Duchamp,"Rational intelligence is dangerous and leads to ratiocination. The painter is a medium who doesn't realize what he is doing. No translation can express the mystery of sensibility, a word, still unreliable, which is nevertheless the basis of painting or poetry, like a kind of alchemy.","[intelligence, painting]",poetry
16,Mary Pope Osborne,"I love reading all kinds of books. I usually have about ten books going at any one time - books about the past, the present, novels, non-fiction, poetry, mythology, religion, etc. Reading is my favorite thing to do.","[love, time, religion]",poetry
17,Victor Hugo,"In the French language, there is a great gulf between prose and poetry; in English, there is hardly any difference. It is a splendid privilege of the great literary languages Greek, Latin, and French that they possess a prose. English has not this privilege. There is no prose in English.","[great, language, privilege]",poetry
18,Saint-John Perse,"The poet existed among the cave men; he will exist among men of the atomic age, for he is an inherent part of man. Even religions have been born from the need for poetry, which is a spiritual need, and it is through the grace of poetry that the divine spark lives forever in the human flint.","[age, spiritual, man]",poetry
19,Patti Smith,"The Bible is very resonant. It has everything: creation, betrayal, lust, poetry, prophecy, sacrifice. All great things are in the Bible, and all great writers have drawn from it and more than people realise, whether Shakespeare, Herman Melville or Bob Dylan.","[great, sacrifice, people]",poetry
20,Langston Hughes,"I was a victim of a stereotype. There were only two of us Negro kids in the whole class, and our English teacher was always stressing the importance of rhythm in poetry. Well, everybody knows - except us - that all Negroes have rhythms, so they elected me class poet.","[teacher, me, victim]",poetry
21,Jean Giraudoux,The flower is the poetry of reproduction. It is an example of the eternal seductiveness of life.,"[life, nature, flower]",poetry
22,John Darnielle,"My father would tell me if I wasn't writing in meter verse, it wasn't poetry.","[father, writing, me]",poetry
23,Johnny Depp,"The beauty, the poetry of the fear in their eyes. I didn't mind going to jail for, what, five, six hours? It was absolutely worth it.","[beauty, fear, eyes]",poetry
24,Robert Adamson,Well I guess the plan was to write poetry and publish books and make a living from writing poetry. That was a pretty ambitious plan I guess.,"[writing, plan, living]",poetry
25,Robert Morgan,"I did not have a very literary background. I came to poetry from the sciences and mathematics, and also through an interest in Japanese and Chinese poetry in translation.","[mathematics, translation]",poetry
