3,Mark Billingham,My dad was a terrible father. Dreadful. But he had a very difficult childhood. He was fostered - he never knew who his father was. So he had a very different attitude to family and kids. I don't have any issues. I'm not suffering some secret angst.,"[family, father, dad]",attitude

8,Grace Slick,"There is an attitude that we should be able to have everything. No, you shouldn't be able to have anything. I'd like a helicopter, but I can't afford a helicopter, so I don't buy one.

9,Arthur Erickson,Part of our western outlook stems from the scientific attitude and its method of isolating the parts of a phenomenon in order to analyze them.,"[analyze, order, parts]",attitude
10,Philip Treacy,"There is no attitude required. The hat brings the attitude. And when people try on a hat they like, it is a bit of fun. It makes them laugh. You don't laugh when you put on a pair of shoes, but you do with a hat.","[fun, shoes, people]",attitude

16,Cheech Marin,"To me, you have to declare yourself a Chicano in order to be a Chicano. That makes a Chicano a Mexican-American with a defiant political attitude that centers on his or her right to self-definition. I'm a Chicano because I say I am.","[i am, yourself, political]",attitude

18,Sara Blakely,"I think failure is nothing more than life's way of nudging you that you are off course. My attitude to failure is not attached to outcome, but in not trying. It is liberating.

22,Bill Rancic,"One by one, all of my college buddies had taken these nothing-special entry-level jobs, pushing papers for $18,000 or $21,000 a year (and hating the work besides), and I'd turn up my nose and tell them I wasn't about to get out of bed for anything less than $50,000. That was my line, my attitude.","[work, college, year]",attitude
23,Pope Benedict XVI,"Having a clear faith, based on the creed of the church is often labeled today as fundamentalism.
