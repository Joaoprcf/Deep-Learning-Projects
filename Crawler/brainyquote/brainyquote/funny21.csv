0,Sarah Silverman,"I think maybe I became funny because as a kid, I was a Jew in a town of no Jews, and being funny just instinctively came about as a way to put people at ease around me.","[people, me, think]",funny
1,Matt Groening,"The conundrum that I face on a daily basis is that I have two sons who have grown up watching 'The Simpsons,' so they know exactly what buttons to push. They know how Bart irritates Homer, and they use these lines against me to tell me that I'm not funny anymore.","[daily, me, face]",funny
2,Noah Baumbach,"As a kid, I thought of myself as a funny person who secretly wanted to be serious, but now I think maybe I'm a serious person who secretly wants to be funny.","[myself, thought, think]",funny
3,Monica Johnson,"It's funny how we 'do' Christmas. Christmas is not something that we do, it is something that was done. It celebrates the long awaited arrival of the Messiah, Jesus Christ. We had nothing to do with it, but what we can do is praise God for the coming of the Lord, who washed away the sins of the world by dying on the cross.","[christmas, god, world]",funny
4,Ben Horowitz,"I had a terrible time hiring rich people. It sounds funny, but the problem is when things go wrong they can ask, 'Why am I doing this?' You don't ever want anybody asking that question. You want them to say, 'I know why I'm doing it, I need the money, let's go' or whatever it is that draws them.","[time, money, people]",funny
5,Dolly Parton,"My mama never wore a pair of pants when I was growing up, and now that's all she wears. It was so funny for me when I first started seeing Mama wear pants. It was like it wasn't Mama. Now I've bought her many a pantsuit because she just lives in them.","[growing up, me, she]",funny
6,Robin Williams,"I basically started performing for my mother, going, 'Love me!' What drives you to perform is the need for that primal connection. When I was little, my mother was funny with me, and I started to be charming and funny for her, and I learned that by being entertaining, you make a connection with another person.","[love, mother, me]",funny
7,Nina Dobrev,"Comedy is probably a lot harder for me. Maybe it's because I've been doing drama for so long or maybe it's because... you don't want to search for a laugh; you can't try to be funny, you just have to naturally be funny or be in a situation that's funny.","[me, laugh, doing]",funny
8,Lee Hall,"I don't really find things funny unless they're deeply tragic at the same time. I think if you're funny just for the sake of being funny, it's just frivolous nonsense. To me, all the best comic plays have been written about really serious and rather bleak things.","[best, time, me]",funny
9,Mark Waters,Kids are funny.,[kids],funny
10,Matthew Stafford,"I really like 'Gladiator.' I like 'The Dark Knight.' I really liked, when I was a kid, 'U.S. Marshalls.' I like funny movies, too. 'Old School' and 'The Hangover.' 'The Hangover' was up there; I liked it.","[school, dark, movies]",funny
11,Autre Ne Veut,I'd rather proliferate funny little rumors than not.,"[rumors, rather, little]",funny
12,Terry Zwigoff,"I try to make a film that's very entertaining, very funny, but also gives you something to think about. And the strongest thing I have to offer is my point of view, to get across how I see the world in hopes that it can change the way other people see the world, hopefully for the better.","[change, world, people]",funny
13,Mary Roach,"Follow your instincts. Do the kind of writing you love to do and do best. 'Stiff' was an oddball book - I mean, a funny book about cadavers? - and I worried that it would be too unconventional. In the end, that's what has made it a success, I think.","[love, success, best]",funny
14,Chris Squire,"Being called a 'music legend' is a very funny thing. It's nice to know that my work has been appreciated and that people have given me that status. On a personal level, however, I can't think about it too much. It means a lot... but then it doesn't.","[music, work, people]",funny
15,Kim Fields,"It's funny how God will just keep using you, and our motto around our family forever has been, 'Just let Him use you.'","[family, god, motto]",funny
16,Maggie Cheung,"I've played a ghost, cat, snake. I've been funny, sad. I've been filmed flying on screen. So why not spend time on something else? I don't need to accept everything I'm offered.","[time, sad, snake]",funny
17,Chris Eigeman,"I really love showing up at work at 10 A.M., trying to make it funny until 3 P.M., and then going home. It's like comedy bankers' hours.","[love, work, home]",funny
18,Shawn Mendes,I like funny girls.,[like],funny
19,Rob McClure,"My initial introduction to him was - this is a funny story... My Aunt Marian, my entire life growing up, told me that I looked like Charlie Chaplin. That didn't really resonate with me when I was younger - I hadn't seen a lot of his films.","[life, growing up, me]",funny
20,Riki Lindhome,"We love super-silly moments, funny moments, serious moments, weird moments.","[love, moments, weird]",funny
21,Khloe Kardashian,"I never looked at myself as the fat sister. Sometimes I would beat people to the punch and say, 'Oh I'm the fat, funny one,' because that's what people would say about me. But I never really thought that.","[myself, sister, people]",funny
22,George Takei,"I do find things funny. When you see life through the eyes of someone with a good sense of humor, which my grandmother did, life is a human comedy.","[life, good, eyes]",funny
23,Al Michaels,"It's funny, but when there are dominant teams, there are a number of people who rail about the fact that they're always seeing the Dallas Cowboys or the San Francisco 49ers or the Green Bay either in the playoffs or in the Super Bowl.","[people, green, super bowl]",funny
24,Seal,"The music industry is really funny, when you have a hit record, everyone knows who are you, everyone wants to do duets with you, then if you have a miss, people suffer from amnesia.","[music, people, you]",funny
25,Paul Epworth,"One of the funny things of being a producer, you have these fleeting, intense relationships with people, and they go off to global megastardom, and you don't see them.","[people, see, you]",funny
