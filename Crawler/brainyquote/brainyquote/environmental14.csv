0,Douglas Brinkley,"I think there's a green side to John Kerry, if you like, that he's an environmental activist. His record on the environment is as best as you have on a pro-environment record of anybody in the U.S. Senate.","[best, environment, green]",environmental
1,Douglas Brinkley,"It's Nixon who created the Environmental Protection Agency. Clean Air and Water Acts. Endangered Species Act. Promoted affirmative action.

8,Noreena Hertz,"Transparency, accountability and sustainability have become the slogans of the market leaders. Companies carry out environmental and social audits to court the consumer, and even the bluest chips woo organisations such as Greenpeace and Amnesty.",[accountability],environmental
9,Annalee Newitz,"As fears about the energy and environmental crises reach a fever pitch, we're all searching for solutions.

14,Chris Gibson,"All too often, the conversation about appropriate and balanced environmental stewardship gets caught up in partisan politics.
