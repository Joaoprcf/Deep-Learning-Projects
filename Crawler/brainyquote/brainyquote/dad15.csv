1,Anthony Kiedis,"As a father now, I wouldn't do what my dad did, because it left me feeling emotionally unstable as a kid. But he didn't do the things he did out of selfishness or malice.","[father, me, feeling]",dad
2,Lydia Ko,"Everyone gets surprised because neither one of my parents play golf. Like I said in my speech, my aunt and uncle really love golf, and we visited them, and she gave me two clubs. Like people think when they don't know who my dad is, they think he's my coach.","[love, parents, golf]",dad
3,Katherine Jenkins,"In Heaven, I believe my dad is somewhere doing something nice. I feel I've been too lucky to travel this far without somebody guiding me.","[travel, believe, me]",dad

6,"Carlos Pena, Jr.","Growing up with my dad, whenever I wanted to try something, he would let me try it but he wouldn't let me give up on it.

7,Zosia Mamet,But my father was also the one who told me I needed to clean up my mouth or I'd never find a man. What's very important to him is manners. Show up on time.

10,Raymond Floyd,"As a kid in Fayetteville, N.C., I played golf all day, every day, a lot of it by myself.

11,Gary Kemp,"I keep my house tidy, because then I can think clearly. I feel the same about myself. Presenting yourself well is a working-class thing - my dad was a printer, but he wore a tie most days. The ungroomed look belongs more to the middle classes.","[myself, yourself, look]",dad

16,John C. Reilly,Most boys' first hero is their father. That was definitely true of my dad. He was a proud Irish American and he taught me a lot about ethics and responsibility. He also introduced me to a lot of wonderful folk music.,"[music, father, hero]",dad
17,Laura Bell Bundy,"My father has a manufacturing company in Kentucky, and he's an electrical engineer. A brilliant man. A brilliant businessman.

20,Jonathan Toews,"My dad started taking me to Winnipeg games when I was 3 or 4. As a kid, I loved Wayne Gretzky, and I remember the first game I got to see him play against the Jets.

24,Jimmy Fallon,"I want to be a dad. That's floating to the top of my list. I think it's such an important thing. I'm at the age where everyone has kids, and I ask them, 'Is it like a puppy?' And they go, 'It's 10 times a puppy.'","[age, want, important]",dad
25,Magic Johnson,"My dad worked two jobs his whole life, and so I told him he's the reason I have 20 jobs.","[life, reason, him]",dad
