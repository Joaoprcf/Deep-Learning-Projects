0,Christopher Nolan,"But in the back of my mind I've always looked to the biggest-scale Hollywood movies. Because to me the most satisfying experience is of watching a movie, if it's done really well. And so that aspiration is always it for me, if I have the opportunity to do it.","[experience, opportunity, me]",movies
1,Christopher Nolan,"To be honest, I don't enjoy watching movies much when I'm working. They tend to fall apart on me a bit.","[me, fall, enjoy]",movies
2,George A. Romero,"People called '28 Days' and '28 Weeks' zombie movies, and they're not! It's some sort of virus; they're not dead.","[people, dead, days]",movies
3,George A. Romero,"Ever since 'Lassie' and 'Old Yeller', I won't watch animal movies. Animals in movies always die.","[animals, die, animal]",movies
4,George A. Romero,"When I was old enough to go to movies alone, I got to see 'Frankenstein' and 'Dracula' on the big screen. I just fell in love with them.","[love, alone, see]",movies
5,Dylan McDermott,"I've always been fascinated by Baretta and Donny Brasco, and other undercover cops in movies.","[always, been, cops]",movies
6,Dylan McDermott,"'Rosemary's Baby' is still one of my favorite movies of all time. The idea of her being impregnated with the devil is just so frightening. I'm actually going to work on a movie in February, called 'Mercy,' from Jason Blum, who produced the 'Paranormal Activity' movies, and there is a similar theme to 'Rosemary's Baby' in the movie.","[work, time, baby]",movies
7,Ellen Barkin,"The way Hollywood portrays mothers - you're either all good and saint-like, or you're all bad. And I think the real honesty of motherhood is not given a voice in movies. I miss that as an audience member.","[good, honesty, voice]",movies
8,Eric Stoltz,"I think violence, cynicism, brutality and fashion are the staples of our diet. I think in the grand history of story-telling, going back to people sitting around fires, the dark side of human nature has always been very important. Movies are part of that tradition.","[nature, history, violence]",movies
9,Andy Murray,"I never read. The paper or anything. I watch a lot of movies, and TV series and stuff. But I never, never read.","[paper, watch, never]",movies
10,Antonio Banderas,"Listen, I think movies serve many different purposes, from those movies that are frivolous and just an entertainment, to movies that just go to exploring the complexities of the human soul. Everything is valid if it's done with honesty and dignity, and I actually do both of those types of movies in my career.","[soul, honesty, career]",movies
11,Antonio Banderas,"I cry a lot, you know. Which is very difficult for a man to recognise, but I do. I cry in movies, you know, just watching movies.","[man, know, difficult]",movies
12,Diane Kruger,Critics can be harsh and I think it's going to take me a long time to make people see what I have inside of me and that I really put my guts into movies and that I'm not superficial and that I'm not just a pretty face.,"[time, people, me]",movies
13,J. J. Abrams,"When I was a little kid - and even still - I loved magic tricks. When I saw how movies got made - at least had a glimpse when I went on the Universal Studios tour with my grandfather, I remember feeling like this was another means by which I could do magic.","[grandfather, magic, remember]",movies
14,Benicio Del Toro,"I'm not saying I'm a writer, but I've been in movies for a long time, and I think I could write a script for a movie.","[time, think, long]",movies
15,John Podhoretz,What people adore about superhero movies is the signal quality of the Christopher Nolan films - their complete lack of irony when it comes to the portrayal of heroism and the need for heroes to confront evil.,"[evil, quality, people]",movies
16,Adam Carolla,"I've never really broken this down before, but, in movies, you almost have no connection to fans. And if you do TV, you're kind of connected, but they know you as the TV name not your real name. If you do radio, there's more of a bond there. And then if you do a podcast it's like you're literally inside of your fans.","[broken, know, name]",movies
17,Seth Rogen,"Luckily, I think, I never really wanted to be famous, I just wanted to make movies.","[think, famous, never]",movies
18,Seth Rogen,"I honestly don't love the Cheech and Chong movies, I've got to say.","[love, say, honestly]",movies
19,Seth Rogen,"I'm not one of those actors where filmmakers that I admire ask me to be in their movies. I meet them at parties and they're nice to me, but they never ask me to work with them.","[work, me, nice]",movies
20,Jonah Hill,"I think our culture has gotten so skewed. People assume that because you're an actor you want to write a book to exploit your celebrity, but my celebrity is only a byproduct of me making movies. I have no intention of being a celebrity.","[culture, book, people]",movies
21,Jonah Hill,"Besides the fact that I make movies, there's nothing interesting about my life at all, unfortunately.","[life, my life, nothing]",movies
22,Carrie Preston,"'That's What She Said' is not Hollywood's standard picture of women: preternaturally gorgeous, wedding obsessed, boy crazy, fashion focused, sexed up 'girl' women. These are real women, comically portrayed, who are trying to wrestle with the very expectations of womanhood that Hollywood movies set up.","[women, wedding, girl]",movies
23,Dave Franco,"I can't say I was like a die-hard zombie fan, but I've definitely seen a few different zombie movies and TV shows.","[say, different, tv shows]",movies
24,Elizabeth Olsen,"I always went to see independent films, they're the movies I'm usually most excited to see.","[see, always, independent]",movies
25,Jerry Saltz,"My nominee for Best Picture of the year - maybe the best picture ever, because it's essentially made up of and is an ecstatic love letter to all other movies - is Christian Marclay's endlessly enticing must-see masterpiece 'The Clock.'","[love, best, year]",movies
