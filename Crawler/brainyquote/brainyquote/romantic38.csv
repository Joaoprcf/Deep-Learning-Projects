0,E. F. Benson,"What man is there, surrounded though he be with the love of wife and children, who does not retain a memory of the romantic affection of boys for each other? Having felt it, he could scarcely have forgotten it, and if he never felt it, he missed one of the most golden of the prizes of youth, unrecapturable in mature life.","[life, love, children]",romantic

3,Robert Taylor,"I grew up in wide-open spaces, but they didn't have the romantic history of the West.","[history, west, spaces]",romantic
4,Henry Grunwald,"In medicine as well as in romantic poetry, it is the heart that is the center and controlling mechanics of life. If the heart stops, life stops. The loss of sight doesn't not mean death. Yet for ages, the eyes was believed to contain a human being's vital essence - a not wholly irrational belief.","[life, death, poetry]",romantic
5,Mary Balogh,I fancy the romantic image of myself being soothed and inspired by music and the sweet aroma and flickering lights of candles.,"[music, myself, sweet]",romantic
6,Irving Stone,"There's nothing romantic about my work... I don't believe in inspiration. I believe that you get to your desk, you stay there, you work, you think of nothing else. You write and you write, and in the end, you write something good.","[work, good, end]",romantic
7,Nigel Cole,"It seems to me that romantic comedies used to be about falling in love, but in recent years they've really become just comedies where the love story is only there as a spine to hang the jokes on.","[love, me, story]",romantic
8,Betty Who,"I don't think of Home Depot as romantic, but I do think the Christmas wonderland they put up during the holidays is magical. That is what Home Depot is to me, and that is the only romantic thing about it.","[christmas, holidays, home]",romantic
9,Jez Butterworth,"I actually have blissfully romantic views of marriage, because that has been my experience of it.","[marriage, experience, views]",romantic
10,Greg Berlanti,"For me, the romantic comedies I love are the ones that pay homage to the genre, but also find their ways to twist it and tweak it.","[love, me, find]",romantic
11,Bryan Burrough,"'Bonnie and Clyde,' while one of the best movies ever made, was far more interested in portraying Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker as romantic anti-establishment Robin Hoods than what they really were: white-trash spree killers.","[best, movies, more]",romantic
12,Jessy Schram,'Terrible' is not a word I would use in shooting romantic scenes with Scott Speedman.,"[shooting, word, terrible]",romantic
13,Michael Masser,"I'm definitely a romantic, no doubt about it.","[doubt, about, definitely]",romantic
14,Bobby Cannavale,I'm getting a lot of uninteresting romantic lead guys that look good and fall in love sort of garbage.,"[love, good, fall]",romantic
15,Aunjanue Ellis,"I'm not married, nor do I want to be. I'm the loving kind but not the marrying kind, though I am romantic.","[i am, want, kind]",romantic
16,Ben Brantley,"I've seen plays that are, objectively, total messes that move me in ways that their tidier brethren do not. That's the romantic mystery of great theater. Translating this ineffability into printable prose is a challenge that can never be fully met.","[great, challenge, me]",romantic
17,Edward Herrmann,"How many times can you play an action character, or a quirky romantic? Every actor has to find his own way to make each character unique.","[character, unique, action]",romantic
18,Ben Wheatley,"The whole idea of genre and categorising films is a critic's construct. For me, I just try and make stories and see where they go, but there's nothing wrong with horror; there's nothing wrong with romantic comedies.","[me, nothing, try]",romantic

22,Mara Brock Akil,"Being black, Latino, or Asian is not a genre. Romantic comedies, thrillers, action - those are genres. I think there's a lot of people who want to have the conversation. I don't think people are afraid of it, I just think it's the time to have that conversation. Race is not a genre.","[time, black, people]",romantic
23,Daniel Dae Kim,"There is as much wisdom in listening as there is in speaking - and that goes for all relationships, not just romantic ones.","[wisdom, listening]",romantic
24,John Lloyd Young,"My interest in acting came from seeing Broadway shows on summer trips to New York as a child. It was the original production of 'A Chorus Line' in an easy tie with the first 10 -15 minutes of Dustin Hoffman in 'Tootsie' that hooked me on the romantic idea that the impossible, difficult life of a struggling actor was for me.","[life, me, summer]",romantic
