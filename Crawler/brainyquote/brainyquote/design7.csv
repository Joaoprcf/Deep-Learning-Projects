0,Michael Kors,"There are two kinds of designers: ones who are very happy locked in their office surrounded by their coterie. The last thing they need to do is to go to a trunk show; they'd go running for the hills. I not only enjoy it, I think, how do you design things that are applicable to life - unless you live it?","[life, happy, live]",design

11,Renzo Piano,"I don't like the idea that the first preparation when you start to design your building has to put your label. I think this is not fair. It's not fair to the building or to the people, to the client, because every building tells a different story.","[preparation, people]",design
12,Mohamed ElBaradei,"Whether one believes in evolution, intelligent design, or Divine Creation, one thing is certain.

18,Whitfield Diffie,"If you depend on a secret for your security, what do you do when the secret is discovered? If it is easy to change, like a cryptographic key, you do so.

You will be vulnerable until you invest the time and money to design another system.","[change, time, money]",design

20,Peter Diamandis,"My personal fascination with the power of the crowd has been growing: Exactly what can a 'crowd' accomplish?
