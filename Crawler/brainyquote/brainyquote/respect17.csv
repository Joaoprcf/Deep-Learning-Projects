1,Suresh Raina,"When you're successful, there will be friends, people, VIPs rallying around you. When you're down and out, you're all alone. That's why it's important to be a good person.

5,Kevin Spacey,"At the end of the day, people have to respect people's differences. I am different than some people would like me to be.","[end, day, i am]",respect
6,Shemar Moore,"Although I have a lot of close female friends in my life, my number one is still my mom. Without her, I wouldn't have the values that I have and see the world the way that I do today.

9,Xavi,"I've no regrets at all, but I still think at times that I would have loved to play in England. You live football over there; it's a great culture. People respect you more; it's more difficult to find respect in Spain. There is more criticism here.","[great, culture, football]",respect

15,Nick Vujicic,"At my funeral, if one said, 'Nick was a generous person,' trust me I won't be doing cartwheels in my coffin. Recognition from people is never and never will be a goal. Some people strive for that respect or honor. Living a life to just reach for the position and status is vanity and sin.","[life, trust, goal]",respect
16,Thierry Henry,"I've always loved New York; I've been visiting New York since 1996. People don't look at you like, 'What are you doing? What are you wearing?'

17,Dennis Prager,"It is easy to respect secular Americans who hold fast to the Constitution and to American values generally.

20,Christopher McQuarrie,"I'm saying, let's learn to reacquire a respect for the power of guns. This culture is so indifferent and disrespectful of guns that we should be terrified.","[power, culture, learn]",respect
21,Mac DeMarco,"I like guitar. It just turned out that it's the instrument I learned to play. I have a lot of respect for it, and I'm learning more and more every day.

23,Lyle Lovett,"Dad often told me, 'My job is to help my boss do his job and make him look good.' That was my dad's objective.

24,Charles Soule,"Specifically with respect to the Inhumans, they are almost a mythological creation in and of themselves - the way they work, the way they operate, the fact that they're royalty - and they've always been involved with a lot of the big cosmos events that Marvel has done.","[work, creation, way]",respect
