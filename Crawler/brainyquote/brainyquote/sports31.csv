2,Dan Jenkins,"Even as a little kid, I was fascinated by newspapers and magazines. They were my TV. I'd be the first one up to grab the morning paper, mainly to look at the sports pictures, the war pictures.","[war, morning, pictures]",sports
3,Dan Jenkins,"The first thing they gave me at 'Sports Illustrated' was a first-class air card. 'And oh, by the way, there's the petty cash drawer,' they told me. 'Take a few thousand dollars for expenses.'","[me, way, cash]",sports
4,Dan Jenkins,"The key to any good sports story is identifying the defining moment. In football games or a boxing match, it's usually pretty obvious. But in golf, sometimes it happens on Thursday. Usually it's Sunday, but guys who don't know the game, they can miss it.","[good, football, golf]",sports
5,Dan Jenkins,"Sally Jenkins of the 'Washington Post' is the best sports columnist in the country. Second best is Gene Wojciechowski of ESPN.com, and third is Dan Wetzel on Yahoo!","[best, country, washington]",sports
6,Randeep Hooda,"Contrary to the royal and uptight image of polo, I want to bring it to a younger generation. This is a great sport that can have a larger audience and appeal to more people. Sportsmanship is lacking in many other sports that I don't want to name.","[great, generation, people]",sports
7,Geoff Dyer,I'm incredibly competitive in all sports in a way that is so mystifying to my wife because she grew up playing the violin and piano. I've always been like that.,"[wife, she, way]",sports
8,LeBron James,"But sports carried me away from being in a gang, or being associated with drugs. Sports was my way out.","[me, way, gang]",sports
9,Johnny Weir,"Michael Phelps is a sporting god among men. It is hard to say if anyone will ever match his accomplishments, but it has been an honor to see him become a legend.

12,Abby Wambach,"When you're a pro athlete, life is very narcissistic - everything relates back to you and how you play.

13,Mike Tyson,I want to rip out his heart and feed it to Lennox Lewis. I want to kill people. I want to rip their stomachs out and eat their children.,"[children, heart, people]",sports

16,Bernie Mac,"I've always been a reserved cat. When I play sports, there's people used to get mad at me because I didn't hang out and things like that. I've never been that kind of person. Nothing has changed in that regard. I've never been posse, and all that. I'm a quiet storm.","[storm, people, me]",sports
17,Bernie Mac,"I hate to let people down. I was like that in sports and I was like that in comedy. I was like that at work. When I worked General Motors and stuff like that, when I say something, I mean it.","[work, hate, people]",sports

19,Aaron Sorkin,"There have been times - and not just on 'The Newsroom,' but on 'The West Wing,' 'Sports Night,' 'Studio 60'... - where it was hard to look the cast and crew in the eye, when I put a script on the table that I knew just wasn't good enough.","[good, night, eye]",sports
20,Aaron Sorkin,"I get the 'The New York Times' and 'Los Angeles Times' thrown at my door every morning.

21,John Madden,One of the biggest gaps in sports is the difference between the winning and losing teams of the Super Bowl. They don't invite the losing team to the White House. They don't have parades for them. They don't throw confetti on them.,"[winning, team, losing]",sports
22,John Madden,"I was an old tackle riding around talking to people about sports. Like I've said to a lot of people over the years, 'I only go where old tackles go, and if an old tackle does not belong there, I'm not going.'","[people, said, talking]",sports
