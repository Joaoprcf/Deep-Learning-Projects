1,Richard Jefferies,The heart looks into space to be away from earth.,"[heart, earth, looks]",space
2,Seth Shostak,It bears mentioning that the Milky Way is only one of 150 billion galaxies visible to our telescopes - and each of these will have its own complement of planets.,"[way, will, visible]",space
3,Tim Berners-Lee,"Sites need to be able to interact in one single, universal space.","[technology, single, need]",space
4,Robert Lanza,"Space and time, not proteins and neurons, hold the answer to the problem of consciousness. When we consider the nerve impulses entering the brain, we realize that they are not woven together automatically, any more than the information is inside a computer.","[time, together, brain]",space
5,Mike Mills,I would hate to think I'm promoting sadness as an aesthetic. But I grew up in not just a family but a town and a culture where sadness is something you're taught to feel shame about. You end up chronically desiring what can be a very sentimental idea of love and connection. A lot of my work has been about trying to make a space for sadness.,"[love, family, work]",space
6,Brian Greene,"Black holes provide theoreticians with an important theoretical laboratory to test ideas. Conditions within a black hole are so extreme, that by analyzing aspects of black holes we see space and time in an exotic environment, one that has shed important, and sometimes perplexing, new light on their fundamental nature.","[time, nature, light]",space
7,Elon Musk,"It is theoretically possible to warp spacetime itself, so you're not actually moving faster than the speed of light, but it's actually space that's moving.","[light, moving, speed]",space
8,Stephen Hawking,Time can behave like another direction in space under extreme conditions.,"[time, direction, behave]",space
9,Elon Musk,"If you look at space companies, they've failed either because they've had a technical solution where success was not a possible outcome, they were unable to attract a critical mass of talent, or they just ran out of money. The finish line is usually a lot further away than you think.","[success, money, finish]",space
10,Mark Kelly,"After the loss of Columbia a couple of years ago, I think we were reminded of the risk. All of us, though, have always known that the Space Shuttle is a very risky vehicle, much more risky than even flying airplanes in combat.","[risk, loss, flying]",space
11,Clifford D. Simak,"It seems to me, thinking of it, that there must be some universal plan which set in motion the orbiting of the electrons about the nucleus and the slower, more majestic orbit of the galaxies about one another to the very edge of space.","[thinking, plan, me]",space
12,Anish Kapoor,One cannot set out to make a work that's spiritual. What is a contemporary iconography for the spiritual? Is it some fuzzy space?,"[work, spiritual, some]",space
13,A. N. Wilson,"Watching a whole cluster of friends, and my own mother, die over quite a short space of time convinced me that purely materialist 'explanations' for our mysterious human existence simply won't do - on an intellectual level.","[time, mother, friends]",space
14,Cat Stevens,"I had to learn my faith and look after my family, and I had to make priorities. But now I've done it all and there's a little space for me to fill in the universe of music again.","[family, music, faith]",space
15,Alexander Payne,"I don't think so much about verbal comedy. I always think about visual comedy. I was raised watching silents, and I'm always thinking about how to make cinema, not good talking - although I want good talking. I'm much more interested in framing, composition, and orchestration of bodies in space, and so forth.","[good, thinking, want]",space
16,Ayaan Hirsi Ali,"I think of Canada, first and foremost, in terms of space. The amount of space available is breathtaking.","[think, canada, first]",space
17,Ralph Waldo Emerson,"The intuition of the moral sentiment is an insight of the perfection of the laws of the soul. These laws execute themselves. They are out of time, out of space, and not subject to circumstance.","[time, perfection, soul]",space
18,Henry Rollins,"I tend to gravitate to the darkest or most obscure part of any venue in an effort to have my own space to experience the music on my own, free from unwanted conversations and other distractions.","[music, experience, effort]",space
19,Henry Rollins,"Now and then, someone is able to look at an empty space, conclude it would be a great place to start a revolution, and bravely go forward.","[great, revolution, forward]",space
20,P. J. O'Rourke,Obama's space policy doesn't differ much from George W. Bush's.,"[policy, much, bush]",space
21,Taylor Swift,I can't deal with someone wanting to take a relationship backward or needing space or cheating on you. It's a conscious thing; it's a common-sense thing.,"[relationship, cheating]",space
22,Douglas Coupland,"I don't know how anyone gets anything done in cities. How can you live somewhere like London or New York, when there are 81 things to do every night? Awful. Give me solitude and space any time.","[time, night, london]",space
23,Douglas Coupland,"Writing is largely about time, while visual art is largely about space.","[time, art, writing]",space
24,Douglas Coupland,"I decided at 40 I was wasting entire chunks of my brain and didn't want to blow my one chance on Earth. I'm glad I made that decision. Writing is largely about time, while visual art is largely about space. Sometimes, as with film, you can hybridize, but I think it's basically the space part of my brain wanting equal footing with the time part.","[time, art, writing]",space
25,Lao Tzu,For the wise man looks into space and he knows there is no limited dimensions.,"[wise, man, wise man]",space
