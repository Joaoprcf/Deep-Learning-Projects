0,Francisco Costa,"I'm inspired by many things, from landscapes to textiles. Art and architecture always influence my design process.","[art, design, influence]",architecture
1,Imogen Poots,"I find the aristocratic parts of London so unattractive and angular; the architecture is so white and gated. But in New York, it's different - even uptown it's really grand, and there's no real segregation there. It's all mixed up.","[london, segregation, find]",architecture
2,Joel Coen,The architecture of a story can be a little bit different if it's a true story.,"[story, true, different]",architecture
3,Anouska Hempel,"I'm not an interior decorator; I'm a designer, and that includes the architecture. The package must be strong and controlled, the rooms aligned, and the windows positioned to make sense with the furniture. Fluff it up, and you've got big trouble.","[strong, furniture, you]",architecture
4,Antony Gormley,"I used to think that the great thing about sculpture was that, like Stonehenge, it was something that stood against time in an adamantine way, and was an absolute mass in space. Now I try to use the language of architecture to redescribe the body as a place.","[time, great, language]",architecture
5,Leonard Susskind,"You are a victim of your own neural architecture which doesn't permit you to imagine anything outside of three dimensions. Even two dimensions. People know they can't visualise four or five dimensions, but they think they can close their eyes and see two dimensions. But they can't.","[eyes, people, know]",architecture
6,Preston Sturges,I worked out a rather deep-dish theory defining the theater as a form of architecture rather than a form of literature.,"[literature, theater, theory]",architecture
7,Anthony Holden,Charles was very intent to use his years as Prince of Wales to make his mark while he still had freedom of maneuver that he wouldn't have as King. The first subject he really went for was architecture. It made an impact.,"[freedom, impact, king]",architecture
8,Michael Graves,"For my first apartment, when I was first married, I went to the lumberyard and bought stuff and made couches. My then-wife made cushions. I was really very interested in furniture. I was in school for architecture, but I had to live, and making furniture was different from designing buildings, which I couldn't do for myself.","[myself, school, live]",architecture
9,Michael Graves,"I'm working on a school of architecture in China. It's rare that an architect gets to design a school of architecture, and here I get to do it. I'm so pleased that they asked me.","[school, design, me]",architecture
10,Michael Graves,"I taught at Princeton for 39 years, and the school of architecture on the campus is the worst building on the campus.","[school, building, worst]",architecture
11,Michael Graves,"You can never draw enough or read enough - reading about architecture, in other words.","[reading, words, you]",architecture
12,Michael Graves,"Instead of using the machine as a metaphor for architecture, as Le Corbusier did, I use the human body. I want the public to know that it's them I'm designing for.","[body, know, want]",architecture
13,Michael Graves,The oldest book I have is a treatise on architecture from the 17th century.,"[book, oldest, century]",architecture
14,Kelsey Grammer,"I think it's important to approach a house in a way that's reflective of the original environment. Maybe I'm a sentimentalist, but I think that certain geographies call out for certain architecture. I like residences that reflect their place.","[environment, important]",architecture
15,Doug Aitken,"The 20th century is a period defined by cultural and artistic movements. However, the 21st century creative-scape that we occupy now doesn't really have movements in the same way. Instead it's made up of diverse individuals working across various platforms simultaneously; art, architecture, film, music and literature.","[music, art, literature]",architecture
16,Doug Aitken,"'Station to Station' came out of a sense of urgency - a sense that culture, be it art, film or architecture, has become so compartmentalised. For this project, we wanted to break that and create a language that is more nomadic and less materialistic and really empowering for the creators and the audience.","[art, culture, language]",architecture
17,Larry Wall,"Post-Modernism was a reaction against Modernism. It came quite early to music and literature, and a little later to architecture. And I think it's still coming to computer science.","[music, science, literature]",architecture
18,Jools Holland,I have realised how exciting and easy it is to be a time traveller by looking at paintings and films and architecture and playing music or listening to it. I don't think you necessarily have to live in the present all the time.,"[music, time, listening]",architecture
19,Oren Peli,I've never owned an Apple product. I like the fact that PCs are open architecture and not locked down like Apple products. I feel that Macs are also unjustifiably overpriced.,"[down, feel, apple]",architecture
20,T. E. Lawrence,"All the revision in the world will not save a bad first draft: for the architecture of the thing comes, or fails to come, in the first conception, and revision only affects the detail and ornament, alas!","[world, detail, ornament]",architecture
21,Marc Newson,People kind of tend to mystify design and architecture by suggesting you need to train.,"[design, people, train]",architecture
22,William Devane,"I would fix other people's lines if they asked me on occasion. The hard part of writing is the architecture of it, getting the story and structuring it. Not the tweaking of lines.","[writing, people, me]",architecture
23,Paul Rand,"If I was influenced by anything, it was architecture: structure having to do with logic. If you don't do it right, the whole thing is going to cave in. In a certain sense, you can carry that to graphic design. Fortunately, however, nobody is going to die if you do it wrong.","[design, logic, die]",architecture
24,Goldwin Smith,"Every one who has a heart, however ignorant of architecture he may be, feels the transcendent beauty and poetry of the mediaeval churches.","[beauty, poetry, heart]",architecture
25,Goldwin Smith,"Yet for my part, deeply as I am moved by the religious architecture of the Middle Ages, I cannot honestly say that I ever felt the slightest emotion in any modern Gothic church.","[i am, church, say]",architecture
