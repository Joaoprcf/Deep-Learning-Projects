6,Charles R. Swindoll,"We can't solve modern problems by going back in time. Retreating to the safety of the familiar is an understandable response, but God has called us to a life of faith. And faith requires us to face the unknown while trusting Him completely.","[life, time, god]",faith

The person to make this atonement must be God and man.,"[trust, god, man]",faith

21,Bobby Bowden,Faith is the most important thing in the world to me. It's the greatest strength I've had. It's helped me get through the hard times.

25,Ridley Scott,"The word 'religion' is only a label. What lies behind that, the most important thing of all, is the word 'faith'.

You're kind of in-between, or you're on the fence.","[religion, important, fence]",faith
