0,Ted McGinley,"I remember in high school trying to get home from water-polo practice in time so I could see Happy Days on television when it first came on, because I was so blown away by it. It was just such a cool thing.","[time, home, happy]",cool
1,Bill Richardson,"President Clinton is going to embrace President Obama, as he should. They are working together. They're different kinds of people. Obama is cool, Clinton is a schmoozer. Both are great speakers. It's a great merging of the party.","[working together, great]",cool
2,Kat Dennings,"There aren't as many girl superheroes, but there are cool ones. Banshee, for instance.","[girl, many, superheroes]",cool
3,Anna Kendrick,"My parents were really, really cool about supporting what I wanted to do at a really young age. I think I was about 10 when I caught the bug. They would drive me down to New York if there were auditions. When I was 12, I did this show on Broadway called 'High Society,' so we moved to New York for the run of that.","[age, society, parents]",cool
4,Hunter Hayes,"There is a bit of a movement as far as younger people in country music. That is cool because people are saying things like, 'I didn't listen to country music until so-and-so came along.' And I'm like, 'Yeah! Now you know why I love it.'","[love, music, people]",cool
5,Dwayne Johnson,"But being on location and shooting, whether its in Puerto Rico or Atlanta, it always reminds me of how really cool my job can be. Interacting with the fans is one of the best parts of it.","[best, job, me]",cool
6,Jane Seymour,"It's interesting because a lot of my 16-year-old kids' friends know me from 'Wedding Crashers,' and not so much Bond. My kids have a good laugh. I was 20 then. The look I had then was the look that a lot of their friends are assuming now. They think it's cool. What goes around comes around.","[good, wedding, friends]",cool
7,Evan Davis,"I've always been scared of advertising folk. I've met them at parties and I've been to their offices and I've always found them intimidatingly cool. At one company I visited, they held their meetings in a caravan that had somehow been installed in the place, a rather more exotic place to gather than the typical BBC glass box.","[advertising, company]",cool
8,Frank Miller,"I thought Daredevil was kind of cool because he couldn't do anything. I mean, he's blind. It wasn't that he could fly. His major power was an impediment. So I was intrigued. When I took over he was kind of like Spider-Man-lite, but I was able to project a lot of my Catholic imagery onto it. And I'd always wanted to do a crime comic.","[power, thought, fly]",cool
9,James Purefoy,"Violence is a very ugly thing. Violence is often so casual on film, and made to look so cool and so sexy, but violence is a repulsive, repugnant act that human beings inflict on each other. It shouldn't seem to be cool and sexy, ever really.","[violence, sexy, ugly]",cool
10,Zachary Levi,"'Aladdin' was probably my favorite Disney animation when I was a kid. The animation was great and Robin Williams was unbelievable as the Genie. 'Aladdin' was an amazing adventure and the lead character was a hero for guys, which I loved. It wasn't a princess or a girl beating the odds; it was a street rat. That seemed really cool to me.","[adventure, hero, great]",cool
11,Lea Michele,"I am an unconventional beauty. I grew up in a high school where if you didn't have a nose job and money and if you weren't thin, you weren't cool, popular, beautiful. I was always told that I wasn't pretty enough to be on television.","[beauty, money, beautiful]",cool
12,Lea Michele,"But my main thing that I would love to see as a fan of 'Glee,' like I said, is to really get into the character and who they are and what they do outside of school. I think that that's interesting. And then of course the themed stuff and the album episodes are all really cool too.","[love, character, school]",cool
13,Lea Michele,"I really felt like I finally made it. Having your first fake pregnancy rumor. It was really awesome. I feel like it's part of what happens in this business, but that's a real one. That's a cool one to get.","[business, fake, awesome]",cool
14,Fergie,"It's cool to express myself, but I've had to learn that doing interviews isn't completely therapy - spilling everything about yourself isn't healthy all the time. But I've been through things that have made me a stronger person, and if I can help some people, I will.","[time, myself, yourself]",cool
15,"Harry Shum, Jr.",Obviously anything that accessorizes or enhances the iPhone is always pretty cool.,"[iphone, always, pretty]",cool
16,Ryan Adams,"I think I've been incredibly raw my whole career. A lot of people spend a lot of time trying to look cool and spend time being guarded and putting up walls. I just never had the time. It seems more honest to say, 'Hey, this is who I am.'","[time, i am, people]",cool
17,Norman Reedus,"I think it's interesting to have a cool character not look so cool, you know?","[character, know, look]",cool
18,Alice Englert,Being in love is not cool!,"[love, love is, being in love]",cool

20,Theo James,"I've got two brothers and two sisters, so there's five of us and we're all very close, which is cool.","[two, us, five]",cool
21,Keegan Allen,"When I was in high school, my friends and I would drive out into the country to abandoned houses and structures... haha... to ghost hunt. We would scare each other so bad! We would sometimes camp out by the abandoned buildings just to scare ourselves! Such good times. The adrenaline of real fear is so cool!","[fear, good, school]",cool
22,Luke Evans,"A guy's biggest style mistake is definitely trying to look too cool. As long as you've got a good pair of jeans, a good pair of boots and a few good shirts, you're fine.","[good, style, trying]",cool
23,Ezra Koenig,"It's pretty cool that people will pay for something even though they don't have to. It's totally different now to back in the day. Now you're paying for a record because you believe in the band. In the future that will be the only time people will pay for albums, because there's some kind of connection.","[time, future, day]",cool
24,Jessica Szohr,The sexiest thing about style is if you kind of just take your personality and put it in what you wear. That's what I think is cool.,"[personality, style, think]",cool
25,Ryan Tedder,"The cool thing about writing music, writing anything, is that once you publish it, it's there forever.","[music, writing, you]",cool
