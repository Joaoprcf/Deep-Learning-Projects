1,Marlon James,"I find the violence in PG13 movies unbearable. This kid will never run home, never have another birthday. His death is slow, nightmarish. And you have to explore the consequences - the people who live on with this death.","[death, home, violence]",birthday

For some reason I thought that it was her birthday.","[life, family, death]",birthday
23,Rebecca Mader,"If I have the power to post 'Happy Birthday' on someone's Facebook page and make them feel really good, it feels really good to make other people feel really good. I love it.
