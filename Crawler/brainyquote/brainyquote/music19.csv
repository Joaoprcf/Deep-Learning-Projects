6,Skrillex,"To me, it's always a joy to create music no matter what it takes to actually get there. The real evils are always whatever stops you from doing that - like if your CPU is spiking and you have to sit there and bounce all your MIDI to audio. Now that's annoying!","[joy, me, doing]",music

20,Karan Johar,"I am a product of Indian cinema; I've grown up watching Indian films ever since I can remember.

It's so boring!","[writing, people, short]",music
