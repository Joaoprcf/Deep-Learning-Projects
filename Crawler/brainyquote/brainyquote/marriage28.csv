5,Ratan Tata,"I came seriously close to getting married four times, and each time I backed off in fear or for one reason or another. Each occasion was different, but in hindsight when I look at the people involved, it wasn't a bad thing what I did. I think it may have been more complex had the marriage taken place.","[time, fear, people]",marriage
6,Myles Munroe,"It is my conviction that marriage is such a good idea, only God could have thought of it.","[god, good, thought]",marriage
7,John Ridley,"The hypocrisy and false piety of the deniers aside, the relationships of gays have no effect on heteros. Especially all the heteros who've done such a marvelous job of debasing marriage on their own all these many years.","[job, relationships]",marriage

11,Dax Shepard,I think I'm a combination of very simple pleasures and the fact I've read a lot of books. I don't think it's a binary opposition across the board in humans and I think I'm an example that it's not. I'm hosting gay marriage rallies and I have tons of guns at home. There's a lot of middle ground in the world and I'm one of those people.,"[home, simple, gay]",marriage

16,Azar Nafisi,"This is a good time to ask apologists for the Islamic regime, who degrades Islam? Who imposes stoning, forced marriage of underage girls and flogging for not wearing the veil?

17,Henry Louis Gates,"The sad truth is that the civil rights movement cannot be reborn until we identify the causes of black suffering, some of them self-inflicted.

18,Marlee Matlin,"There are many deaf people who couldn't imagine living in a marriage without someone who doesn't speak their language.

But if there's no communication, then the marriage, I believe, will be difficult if not doomed.","[communication, believe]",marriage
19,Marco Rubio,"Supporting the definition of marriage as one man and one woman is not anti-gay: it is pro-traditional marriage. And if support for traditional marriage is bigotry, then Barack Obama was a bigot until just before the 2012 election.","[woman, support, man]",marriage

21,Gary Johnson,"Most Americans are fiscally conservative and socially liberal. I'm advocating a balanced budget. But along with that, look, there should be gay marriage equality. A woman should have the right to choose. Let's not build a fence across the border.","[equality, woman, gay]",marriage
22,A. P. J. Abdul Kalam,"Regarding marriage, it - somehow, it didn't happen. One fellow in such a big family not getting married is not an issue.","[family, happen, big]",marriage
23,Penny Jordan,"I was too ashamed and afraid to confide in friends, and wanted to convince others and myself that my marriage was a success. I lost myself in my writing.

24,Edmund White,I've always deplored bad heterosexual values that dictate the minute a marriage is over the former partners no longer speak to each other; only straights could be so cruel and inhuman as to reject totally the person with whom they've shared their life for 20 or 30 years.,"[life, speak, values]",marriage
25,Thomas Haden Church,"Their lives have been largely defined by failure and you would think the prospect of marriage, which is supposed to be bountiful and hopeful, it's just really another kind of tangential thing in his life.","[life, failure, think]",marriage
