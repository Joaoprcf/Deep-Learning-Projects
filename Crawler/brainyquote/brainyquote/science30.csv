1,Maria Mitchell,"We especially need imagination in science. It is not all mathematics, nor all logic, but it is somewhat beauty and poetry.","[beauty, poetry, mathematics]",science
2,Thomas Love Peacock,I almost think it is the ultimate destiny of science to exterminate the human race.,"[destiny, think, race]",science
3,Henry Taube,The benefits of science are not to be reckoned only in terms of the physical.,"[benefits, only, physical]",science
4,Owen Chamberlain,"The development of physics, like the development of any science, is a continuous one.","[development, physics, like]",science
5,Henrik Ibsen,"What business has science and capitalism got, bringing all these new inventions into the works, before society has produced a generation educated up to using them!","[business, society]",science
6,Theodore Roosevelt,"Germany has reduced savagery to a science, and this great war for the victorious peace of justice must go on until the German cancer is cut clean out of the world body.","[peace, war, great]",science

8,John Coleman,Global Warming: It is a hoax. It is bad science. It is high-jacking public policy. It is the greatest scam in history.,"[history, greatest]",science
9,Paul Krugman,The science fiction world has a lot of people doing seriously imaginative thinking.,"[thinking, world, people]",science
10,A. P. J. Abdul Kalam,"Science is global. Einstein's equation, E=mc2, has to reach everywhere. Science is a beautiful gift to humanity, we should not distort it. Science does not differentiate between multiple races.","[beautiful, gift, humanity]",science
11,Stephen Hawking,Science predicts that many different kinds of universe will be spontaneously created out of nothing. It is a matter of chance which we are in.,"[universe, chance, nothing]",science
12,Greg Bear,Science fiction works best when it stimulates debate.,"[best, debate, fiction]",science
13,Gabriel Garcia Marquez,"Faulkner is a writer who has had much to do with my soul, but Hemingway is the one who had the most to do with my craft - not simply for his books, but for his astounding knowledge of the aspect of craftsmanship in the science of writing.","[knowledge, soul, writing]",science
14,Ken MacLeod,"Science fiction made me aware of how big and strange the universe was, leaving aside the whole question of aliens.","[universe, me, leaving]",science
15,James Buchan,"Nature is not simply a technical or economical resource, and human beings are not mere numbers. To suggest that one can somehow align all the squabbling institutions of science, environmental management, government and diplomacy in an alliance of convenience to regulate the global climate seems to me optimistic.","[nature, environmental]",science
16,Lewis Thomas,"We're as clever as we think we are, but we'll be a lot cleverer when we learn to use not just one brain but to pool huge numbers of brains. We're at a level technologically where we can share information and think collectively about our problems. We do it in science all the time - there's no reason why we can't do it in other endeavors.","[time, brain, problems]",science
17,Malcolm Turnbull,"If Margaret Thatcher took climate change seriously and believed that we should take action to reduce global greenhouse emissions, then taking action and supporting and accepting the science can hardly be the mark of incipient Bolshevism.","[change, climate change]",science

19,Jaron Lanier,"I've always felt that the human-centered approach to computer science leads to more interesting, more exotic, more wild, and more heroic adventures than the machine-supremacy approach, where information is the highest goal.","[goal, information]",science
20,Ben Carson,"There's no question that as science, knowledge and technology advance, that we will attempt to do more significant things. And there's no question that we will always have to temper those things with ethics.","[technology, knowledge]",science
21,Paul Davies,"Cosmologists have attempted to account for the day-to-day laws you find in textbooks in terms of fundamental 'superlaws,' but the superlaws themselves must still be accepted as brute facts. So maybe the ultimate laws of nature will always be off-limits to science.","[nature, facts, find]",science
22,Ken Wilber,"The Enlightenment was an attempt to liberate myth and base truth claims on evidence, not just dogma. But when science threw out the church, they threw out the baby with the bath water.","[truth, water, baby]",science
23,Richard Dooling,"The most interesting character to me is someone who is stuck in the no man's land between Belief and Unbelief, Faith and Faithlessness. I'm capitalizing like a German, but it doesn't matter whether it's faith in a person or in God, or belief in science or whatever, it's the desperate in-between state that makes for interesting dramatic tension.","[god, faith, character]",science
24,Kenneth R. Miller,"I am always struck by the fact that human awareness of our place in nature, like so much of modern science, began with the Industrial Revolution.","[nature, i am]",science
25,Bruno Latour,"The only shibboleth the West has is science. It is the premise of modernity and it defines itself as a rationality capable of, indeed requiring separation from politics, religion and really, society. Modernisation is to work towards this.","[work, politics, religion]",science
