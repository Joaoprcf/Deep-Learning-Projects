0,Richard Phillips,"There was a belief after World War I that painting could be an act of civil revolt. I want this exhibition, 'New Museum,' to be an act of civil disobedience. It's not so much about the New Museum on the Bowery, but the idea of challenging museums as projections of cultural authority. It's painting as insurgency.","[world, world war i, painting]",war

2,Sunni Brown,"Under no circumstances should doodling be eradicated from a classroom or a boardroom or even the war room.

4,Michio Kaku,"We have to realize that science is a double-edged sword. One edge of the sword can cut against poverty, illness, disease and give us more democracies, and democracies never war with other democracies, but the other side of the sword could give us nuclear proliferation, biogerms and even forces of darkness.","[science, darkness, poverty]",war
5,Bayard Rustin,"War is wrong. Conscription for war is inconsistent with freedom of conscience, which is not merely the right to believe but to act on the degree of truth that one receives, to follow a vocation which is God-inspired and God-directed.","[freedom, truth, believe]",war
6,Rick Atkinson,"Almost everything about American society is affected by World War II: our feelings about race; our feelings about gender and the empowerment of women, moving women into the workplace; our feelings about our role in the world. All of that comes in a very direct way out of World War II.","[women, society, gender]",war
7,Jonathan Winters,"The most terrible fear that anybody should have is not war, is not a disease, not cancer or heart problems or food poisoning - it's a man or a woman without a sense of humor.","[food, fear, heart]",war
8,Judith Butler,"I don't think we have to have a personal relation to a life lost to understand that something terrible has taken place, especially in the context of war.","[life, lost, think]",war
9,Bill O'Reilly,"Americans who have parents raised during the Great Depression or World War II understand how drastically things have changed on the home front.

10,Oriana Fallaci,"When you have been born in a war like me, living in a war as a child, when you have been in wars as a war correspondent all your life - trust me! You develop a form of fatalism; you are always ready to die.","[life, trust, me]",war

12,Don Everly,"Dad wouldn't let me fool with his guitar much, because I'm left-handed, and I'd pick it up upside down.

14,Mohamed ElBaradei,"Whether one believes in evolution, intelligent design, or Divine Creation, one thing is certain. Since the beginning of history, human beings have been at war with each other, under the pretext of religion, ideology, ethnicity and other reasons. And no civilization has ever willingly given up its most powerful weapons.","[history, religion, design]",war
15,Paul Conroy,"Britain, along with the U.S.A., is war weary, and after the travesty of Iraq and Afghanistan, has grave misgivings in any future involvement in the Middle East. The ghost of Tony Blair and his single-minded determination to attack Iraq, at any cost, has cast a long shadow over British politics. The British public have a long collective memory.","[future, determination]",war
16,Neil deGrasse Tyson,"The only driver stronger than an economic argument to do something is the war argument, the I-don't-want-to-die argument.","[stronger, argument, economic]",war

20,Emmeline Pankhurst,"From infancy, I had been accustomed to hear pro and con discussions of slavery and the American Civil War. Although the British government finally decided not to recognise the Confederacy, public opinion in England was sharply divided on the questions both of slavery and of secession.","[slavery, government]",war
21,Scott Anderson,"The modern Middle East was largely created by the British. It was they who carried the Allied war effort in the region during World War I and who, at its close, principally fashioned its peace. It was a peace presaged by the nickname given the region by covetous British leaders in wartime: 'The Great Loot.'","[peace, great, effort]",war
22,Walter Kirn,"The success that Americans are said to worship is success of a specific sort: accomplished not through hard work, primarily, but through the ingenious angle, the big break. Sit down at a lunch counter, stand back up a star. Invest in a new issue and watch it soar. Split a single atom, win a war.","[success, work, hard work]",war
