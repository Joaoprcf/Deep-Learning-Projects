0,Joshua Waitzkin,"One of the main focuses of my training sessions is to help individuals find their unique voices in the learning process.

1,Louise L. Hay,"The gateways to wisdom and learning are always open, and more and more I am choosing to walk through them.

5,Magnus Scheving,"The worst mistake you can make with children is to talk to them in a condescending, patronising way and think that you can teach them something.

6,Lakshmi Mittal,"This is a learning in the business life that first of all you need to have commitment, dedication and passion for what you are doing.","[life, business, passion]",learning
7,Andrea Bocelli,"For me, riding a two-wheeler bike was very risky.

8,Chuck Close,"There are so many artists that are dyslexic or learning disabled, it's just phenomenal. There's also an unbelievably high proportion of artists who are left-handed, and a high correlation between left-handedness and learning disabilities.","[dyslexic, high, disabilities]",learning
9,Bonnie Raitt,"Especially girls, but any kids exposed to music programs and arts programs do much better on their tests. They have a better chance of going to college. They can focus better.

All of that's great, but you've got to build a whole person.","[music, work, science]",learning

12,Drew Gilpin Faust,"I lived in a world where social arrangements were taken for granted and assumed to be timeless. A child's obligation was to learn these usages, not to question them.

15,Heidi Hayes Jacobs,"As educators, we are only as effective as what we know. If we have no working knowledge of what students studied in previous years, how can we build on their learning? If we have no insight into the curriculum in later grades, how can we prepare learners for future classes?","[knowledge, future, grades]",learning

17,Wayne Dyer,Fear is present when we forget that we are a part of God's divine design.

19,Neil Peart,"The real test of a musician is live performance. It's one thing to spend a long time learning how to play well in the studio, but to do it in front of people is what keeps me coming back to touring.","[time, people, me]",learning
20,Leo Buscaglia,"The minute we stop learning, we begin death, the process of dying. We learn from each other with every action we perform. We are teaching goodness or evil every time we step out of the house and into the street.","[time, death, evil]",learning
21,Robert Baden-Powell,"It always seems to me so odd that when a man dies, he takes out with him all the knowledge that he has got in his lifetime whilst sowing his wild oats or winning successes.
