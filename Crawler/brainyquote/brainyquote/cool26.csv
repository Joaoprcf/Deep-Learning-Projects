0,Justin Vernon,"I'm just happy and proud to be playing music every day. Recognition is really cool, but it can also be kind of scary.","[music, happy, day]",cool

2,Morgan Saylor,"I've always enjoyed searching for clothes. I like thrift stores and vintage stuff, and not so much going to Urban Outfitters. What got me interested is having to choose dresses for the carpet, and doing a lot of shoots with really cool clothes. I've gotten to try on a lot of things that I've liked, and some things that I haven't.","[me, doing, choose]",cool
3,Morgan Saylor,"I'm trying to be more put-together. My closets are very messy. I like Rebecca Minkoff; her clothes are casual, but cool. I love Band of Outsiders. And ASOS makes a lot of good stuff. I can get lost on their website for hours. I don't like to spend a lot of money on clothes.","[love, money, good]",cool
4,Eiza Gonzalez,"I'm born and raised in Mexico. I only spent eight months in the States, but definitely English is a really big part of my life, and I love it. Thank God my mom put me in American school because I'm able to be working in the States, and it opens a lot more doors being half and not being only one. It's cool because I get to turn it on and off.","[life, love, god]",cool
5,Eiza Gonzalez,"I can have an accent and not have an accent, so it's really cool. I can play with it. I can be very Sofia Vergara, too, so it's really cool.","[play, i can, accent]",cool
6,Mark Pellegrino,"I think what draws people into 'Supernatural' is that when all is said and done, and the ash from the various apocalypses settle, it's about the brothers. Even though there's cool fights in this and cool special effects, and there's superheroes... in the end, it is about family. Two families: the family by blood and family by choice.","[family, end, people]",cool
7,E. L. Doctorow,"I started on computers with 'Billy Bathgate,' a little orange screen with black letters. I thought it was really cool, but it actually slowed me up for a while because it's so easy to revise, I tended to stay on the same page. I've learned to discipline myself.","[myself, discipline]",cool
8,Michael Mosley,"I've been on pilots. I've seen shows come and go. I know that this stuff is all very fleeting, so I try to keep it cool.","[know, come and go, try]",cool
9,Alexandra Daddario,"My mom used to model when she was younger, before she went to law school, and I think she thought it was pretty cool. I think my parents saw that acting ultimately made me happy, even though it was a rough ride for a little bit.","[mom, happy, school]",cool
10,Brian Helgeland,I think 'Cool Hand Luke' was probably the first movie in which I was aware of the writing as its own separate thing. It was that speech when the guy reads Paul Newman the riot act. The speech about going in the box.,"[writing, speech, think]",cool
11,Brian Helgeland,"I don't really write with living actors in mind. I guess I write for dead actors. I'll think of like, you know, Burt Lancaster would be good in this part, and so on. With 'L.A. Confidential,' it was like, 'Wouldn't it be cool if Dean Martin played the Kevin Spacey part?'","[good, mind, living]",cool
12,Constance Zimmer,"I have this obsession with really cool, old books.","[obsession, old, books]",cool
13,Masashi Kishimoto,"Exaggeration can lend action scenes more force, but I like to stick to more realistic figures: They help keep the cool in the action scenes, although they may be not as forceful as the exaggerated ones.","[help, action, may]",cool
14,Hannah Simone,All of my relationships have happened organically with people who are super cool and in my life and it just moved into a relationship zone.,"[life, relationship, people]",cool
15,Jim Rash,"I think what's cool about a body-switching movie is, 'The grass is always greener:' the idea that someone else has a better life than I do.","[life, someone, better]",cool
16,Stacey Snider,"You need to be grounded internally and excited about the world around you. If I were out of touch, it would be hard for me to know why Michael Cera is so cool.","[world, me, know]",cool
17,Christopher Mintz-Plasse,"I never got a chance to take advantage of 'Superbad' at school because I graduated before it came out, so I never got to use any of my fame to pick up girls and go to cool parties.","[school, chance, fame]",cool
18,Lucy Punch,Trying to look cool and lovely in comedy is a recipe for disaster. You have to let go.,"[trying, look, you]",cool
19,Tim O'Reilly,There is a possibility of fresh talent coming to work for the government. Millennials are the most public-spirited generation since the 1960s. There is an opportunity to harness that generation and make government service cool again.,"[work, opportunity, service]",cool
20,Pierce Brosnan,"The forties are very cool and very pastoral. The fifties look like they're pastoral, and then you get a bit more turbulence.","[look, you, fifties]",cool
21,Nina Garcia,"I love shopping for guys! A watch is a fantastic gift idea - an oversized, stainless steel version with links is classic and cool.","[love, gift, shopping]",cool
22,Adam DeVine,My parents are very cool and wildly supportive - maybe almost too much. I want to tell them to chill out.,"[parents, want, chill]",cool
23,Robert T. Bakker,"I'll bet you a six-pack of Coors that pretty soon, people will be discovering Cretaceous parasites inside Cretaceous bones. The possibility of looking into epidemiology and pathology is pretty cool.","[people, looking, you]",cool
24,Orlando Bloom,I used to ride motorbikes and drive cars like everything was a racetrack; it was ridiculous. It wasn't because I thought it was cool; it was just because I loved living on the edge. But I've chilled.,"[thought, living, ride]",cool
25,Maisie Williams,"I look at other people my age in this industry, other famous people my age, and they've just got famous friends. Which is cool, but I love being normal and just chilling at mine.","[love, age, friends]",cool
