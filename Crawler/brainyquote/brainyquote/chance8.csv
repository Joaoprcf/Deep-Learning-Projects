1,Leland Ryken,"It is true that the Puritans banned all recreation on Sundays and all games of chance, gambling, bear baiting, horse racing, and bowling in or around taverns at all times. They did so, not because they were opposed to fun, but because they judged these activities to be inherently harmful or immoral.","[horse, fun, gambling]",chance
2,Nathan Myhrvold,"There is a one-in-300 chance that Earth will be struck on March 16, 2880, by an asteroid large enough to destroy civilization and possibly cause the extinction of the human race. But, on the bright side, Prince could re-release his hit song with the new refrain 'We're gonna party like its twenty-eight seventy-nine.'","[earth, party, song]",chance
3,Ronda Rousey,"The Olympics is a once-in-a-lifetime thing. I was lucky enough to go twice, but most people only get one chance. And in judo you can train your whole life and it'll come down to a split second: You can lose everything or win anything.","[life, people, win]",chance

5,Neil Patrick Harris,"It's good to have a lot of once-in-a-lifetimes in your lifetime. If you get the chance to skydive, go skydiving. If you're offered a part in a weird Shakespeare play in San Diego, slap on some tights and rock out some iambic pentameter.","[good, weird, you]",chance
6,Chris Hardwick,"I think for a lot of people, bowling is sort of a joke.

8,Stephen Lang,"With correction, and given the chance, 'Terra Nova' can and will deliver seasons of transcendent images and story-telling. Failing to renew 'Terra Nova' is shortsighted, as myopic as it would have been to scrap the Hubble. 'Terra Nova' is the Hubble Telescope of television.","[seasons, television, failing]",chance
9,Bonnie Raitt,"Especially girls, but any kids exposed to music programs and arts programs do much better on their tests. They have a better chance of going to college. They can focus better. You know, we're not just automatons learning how to work machines and do engineering and math and science. All of that's great, but you've got to build a whole person.","[music, work, learning]",chance
10,David Attenborough,"I don't like rats, but there's not much else I don't like. The problem with rats is they have no fear of human beings, they're loaded with foul diseases, they would run the place given half the chance, and I've had them leap out of a lavatory while I've been sitting on it.","[fear, problem, no fear]",chance
11,Josh Homme,"I think one of the coolest things you can do is disappear for a while, because it gives you the chance to re-emerge. To sort of pounce out of the jungle.","[think, you, jungle]",chance

15,Louis Tomlinson,"You can lay in bed and think you don't stand a chance, that's what all of us thought, and here we are. We ended up doing all right.","[thought, stand, doing]",chance
16,Muhammad Ali,"When I won the Golden Gloves in 1960, that made me realize I had a chance. And when I won at the Olympics, that sealed it: I was the champ.","[me, realize, golden]",chance
17,Becki Newton,"After leaving school, I travelled around Europe for about six months. In Denmark, I thought that was my chance to get an amazing haircut, so I went to what I thought was a great hairdresser. It turned out to be the car wash of hairdressers, and I walked out sporting yet another pudding bowl, but this time with a stripe bleached down the centre.","[time, great, car]",chance
18,Krzysztof Kieslowski,"I like chance meetings - life is full of them. Every day, without realising it, I pass people whom I should know.","[life, day, people]",chance

21,Peter Dinklage,"Any swagger is just defense.

You can turn it on its head and use it yourself before anybody else gets a chance.","[yourself, people, dark]",chance
22,Charles M. Schwab,Money is often a matter of chance or good fortune and is not the mark of a successful life. It is not the thing that brings a throb of pleasure or a thrill into my life. And I would not pose as a successful man if that were to be the measure.,"[life, money, good]",chance
23,Narendra Modi,"If you call yourself a leader, then you have to be decisive. If you're decisive, then you have the chance to be a leader. These are two sides to the same coin.","[leader, yourself, you]",chance

25,Trent Franks,"If Donald Trump is our nominee, I don't think that he represents the best our party has to offer either in temperament or qualification, and I think he's the weakest candidate that is in the race at this point in terms of the general election, and that to nominate him is to give Hillary Clinton a much better chance of being president.","[best, election, party]",chance
