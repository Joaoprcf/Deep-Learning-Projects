1,Sharon Salzberg,"The first of the four noble truths of Buddhism, that there is suffering in life, was enormously important to me. No one had ever said it out loud. That had been my experience, of course, but no one had ever talked about it. I didn't know what to do with all the fear and emotions within, and here was the Buddha saying this truth right out loud.","[life, fear, truth]",experience
2,Ted Dekker,"For me, writing is an experience. It's an exercise in which I want to discover myself by taking my characters to the edges of human experience, to the edges of themselves and then, asking certain questions - about love, what does it mean to love? What's beauty? What is true beauty? What does it mean to be insane - crazy?","[love, beauty, myself]",experience
3,David Tennant,"Drama school is a pretty intense experience, and I think it changes who you are.","[school, changes, think]",experience
4,Blake Mycoskie,"As entrepreneurs, we often get pressured into hiring an industry executive. While it's good to hire people with experience, it can also be a stumbling block because they think about the business the same way everyone else does.","[business, good, people]",experience
5,Vikram Seth,"Poetry, I think, intensifies the reader's experience. If it's a humorous facet of the story, poetry makes it more exuberant. If it's a sad facet, poetry can make it more poignant.","[sad, poetry, story]",experience
6,Zadie Smith,"There is a kind of desperate need for somebody to tell everyone what to do, which I find really peculiar in America. And then when you tell them, they're not interested, because it's also a country where everybody's opinion is their opinion, and they really don't give a damn what you think. So it's a very odd experience.","[america, opinion, find]",experience
7,Edward Ruscha,"Traveling to Europe and traveling in the U.S.A. was a much different experience. 'On the Road' exemplified everything glamorous that was happening on this side of the planet. The book puts off some kind of sweet melody - part hope for the world, part nostalgic.","[hope, book, road]",experience
8,Meher Baba,One has to go beyond the mind to experience the spiritual bliss of desirelessness.,"[spiritual, mind, beyond]",experience
9,David Stern,"By nature, I'm a person who always says that whatever I've done, I could've done better. But I don't dwell on it because I'm waiting for the next time something happens and try to believe that my past experience will have helped to educate me in terms of how I deal with future ones.","[time, nature, future]",experience
10,Rufus Wainwright,"The Germany I was enthused with was more old fashioned and kind of romantic. I just got there, and the next thing you know, I had this huge gilded album. It was kind of an amazing experience because I didn't intend it to be that way.","[romantic, amazing, know]",experience
11,Rachel Cusk,"As it stands, motherhood is a sort of wilderness through which each woman hacks her way, part martyr, part pioneer; a turn of events from which some women derive feelings of heroism, while others experience a sense of exile from the world they knew.","[women, woman, world]",experience
12,Chip Conley,"Daniel Goleman has proven that two-thirds of the success in business is based upon our Emotional Intelligence as opposed to our IQ or our level of experience. As we look for the next crop of future CEOs, maybe it's time for America's corporations to start interviewing grads from the psychology master's programs rather than the M.B.A. programs.","[success, time, business]",experience
13,Joss Whedon,"I designed 'Buffy' to be an icon, to be an emotional experience, to be loved in a way that other shows can't be loved. Because it's about adolescence, which is the most important thing people go through in their development, becoming an adult.","[people, loved, important]",experience
14,Anthony Bourdain,"Hong Kong is a wonderful, mixed-up town where you've got great food and adventure. First and foremost, it's a great place to experience China in a relatively accessible way.","[adventure, food, great]",experience
15,Antoine Predock,"The connection to place, to the land, the wind, the sun, stars, the moon... it sounds romantic, but it's true - the visceral experience of motion, of moving through time on some amazing machine - a few cars touch on it, but not too many compared to motorcycles. I always felt that any motorcycle journey was special.","[time, journey, romantic]",experience
16,Mel Gibson,I have learned that a bitter experience can make you stronger. I now boastfully say that I have a hide like a rhinoceros... and I'm smiling. It's an interesting thing.,"[stronger, you, interesting]",experience
17,Janine Shepherd,"We can think so much about life and take ourselves so seriously; I mean, I like to tell people, 'Don't take life too seriously' because you'll cloud the experience. That's what the meaning of life is to me - being able to enjoy the moment.","[life, meaning of life]",experience
18,Anne-Marie Duff,"As I get older, I want to draw on my experience to make roles better. I see that in the older women who inspire me - their experience makes them better.","[women, inspire, me]",experience
19,Doug Jones,"I learned mime back when I was in college, at Ball State University, Indiana. That woke up my body from the neck down and made me realize that acting and communication - portraying a story, event, or emotion - is a full-body experience.","[communication, college, me]",experience
20,James Wan,"For me and my films, I want my audience to experience cinema in its full glory. It's not just visual, it's audio as well. It's emotional, and I want you to be engaged with not just the scene but with the characters.","[me, want, you]",experience
21,Ryan Newman,"It definitely helps to have the acting experience going into singing, because when you're singing, you have to portray the emotion you were feeling when you wrote the song. They're the same thing, in a way; it's expressing your emotions through words.","[words, singing, acting]",experience
22,Arjun Rampal,"Even though I always knew I had a good nose for fragrances, the process of creating my own, 'Alive,' turned out to be a great learning experience for me. And the name explains my reason behind it. Smelling good makes you feel alive.","[learning, good, great]",experience
23,Angela Ahrendts,"I am not in favour of quotas. Just put the best person into the job. It is not about gender; it is about experience, leadership and vision.","[leadership, best, vision]",experience
