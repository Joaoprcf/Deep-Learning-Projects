0,Maxwell Caulfield,"I am beyond thrilled to be hitting the road with 'Singin' in the Rain.'

1,Daniel Barenboim,"It's funny, because in 1970 I met the Beatles quite by a chance at a party. It was the Beethoven bicentenary, and I was then also playing the Beethoven Sonatas.

2,Ross Mathews,"Not to be too preachy, but I would really recommend to people, if you get the chance, to trust yourselves to leap without a net, because that will build the confidence.

3,Stephen Colletti,"Who I was back then, when I started on 'One Tree Hill,' is so different from who I am now.

I like it when we can hear what we're doing.","[love, good, great]",chance
6,Monte Irvin,"Oscar Charleston was the Willie Mays of his day. Nobody ever played center field better than Willie Mays. Suppose they had never given Willie a chance, and we said that, would anybody believe there was a kid in Alabama who was that good? Or there was a black guy in Atlanta who might break Babe Ruth's home run record? No.","[home, good, day]",chance
7,William Wells Brown,"All I demand for the black man is, that the white people shall take their heels off his neck, and let him have a chance to rise by his own efforts.","[man, black, people]",chance

19,Peter Diamandis,"If someone is always to blame, if every time something goes wrong someone has to be punished, people quickly stop taking risks. Without risks, there can't be breakthroughs.","[time, people, blame]",chance
20,Penny Pritzker,"I tend to be a person who starts with the presumption that I should trust you until you abuse the privilege, and then our relationship is forever changed. That's a very big line, and chances are it's not going to work if it's crossed. I warn people that this is how I'm going to deal with it.","[work, relationship, trust]",chance
21,Randy Quaid,"I don't trust Santa Barbara as far as I can spit.

24,Dwyane Wade,"At 9 years old, I moved in with my father because my mother could no longer care for me. Looking back, I now see so many similarities between my own childhood and that of my sons.

25,CeeLo Green,"I'm all about taking chances. You have to ask yourself, if you're not taking any chances, are you actually even living?
