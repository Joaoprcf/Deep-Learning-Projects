0,Charles H. Townes,"The development of science is basically a social phenomenon, dependent on hard work and mutual support of many scientists and on the societies in which they live.","[work, hard work, support]",science
1,Charles H. Townes,"There is some truth to the idea that, in the fields of science, individual contributions of great significance are possible.","[truth, great, possible]",science
2,Charles H. Townes,"I was very eager to produce an oscillator for short waves. I was doing science with microwaves, and I would get down to a few millimetres in wavelength, but I wanted to get shorter wavelengths; I wanted to get into the infra-red because I saw there was a lot more to be done there.","[short, doing, down]",science
3,Martin Rees,"The scientific community should work as hard as possible to address major issues that affect our everyday lives such as climate change, infectious diseases and counterterrorism; in particular, 'clean energy' research deserves far higher priority. And science and technology are the prime routes to tackling these issues.","[change, work, technology]",science
4,Martin Rees,"Science is the one culture that's truly global - protons, proteins and Pythagoras's Theorem are the same from China to Peru. It should transcend all barriers of nationality. It should straddle all faiths, too.","[culture, china, same]",science
5,Richard Engel,"Iraq was home of the Abbasid Caliphate, a golden age when the Muslim world was at the forefront of math, science and medicine.","[home, age, world]",science
6,Anita Borg,"Until Systers came into existence, the notion of a global 'community of women in computer science' did not exist.","[women, community]",science
7,Buzz Aldrin,"For the future, primarily, we must educate people in science, engineering, technology and math.","[technology, future]",science
8,Evangeline Lilly,"'Why are we here?' 'What is our purpose? 'Is there an afterlife?' 'Is there a God?' 'Is it all about science?' Those are big questions, and usually, TV is a little scared to go there.","[god, purpose, questions]",science
9,Leonard Susskind,"Whether or not evolution is compatible with faith, science and religion represent two extremely different worldviews, which, if they coexist at all, do so most uncomfortably.","[faith, religion, evolution]",science
10,Mary Roach,"Ultimately, the problem is that sex is perceived as a personal, intimate thing, not in the realm of science. But that's not true. It's physiology; it's anatomy. It deserves to be studied.","[problem, sex, true]",science
11,Steve Jobs,"I learned about serif and san serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture, and I found it fascinating.","[great, beautiful, space]",science
12,Alastair Reynolds,"I think I set myself on a course to become a scientist around about the time that Carl Sagan's 'Cosmos' series was on television, and there really was no going back for me at that point, and then I went on to study space science and then get my Ph.D., then go aboard and work in the European Space Agency.","[work, time, myself]",science
13,Rebecca Stead,"I never had a favourite book! I liked all kinds of things - science fiction, so I read Heinlen and Ray Bradbury, and I also liked reading about kids like myself, so I read Judy Blume and Norma Klein and Paula Danzinger and a lot of other writers. I also read James Herriot!","[myself, book, reading]",science
14,Mary Baker Eddy,"Chastity is the cement of civilization and progress. Without it there is no stability in society, and without it one cannot attain the Science of Life.","[life, progress, society]",science
15,James C. Maxwell,"All the mathematical sciences are founded on relations between physical laws and laws of numbers, so that the aim of exact science is to reduce the problems of nature to the determination of quantities by operations with numbers.","[nature, determination]",science
16,Kevin J. Anderson,"I wanted the feel in these books to be like an epic fantasy, with kings, queens, dukes and court politics, but of course like what I was explaining before, about making the science make sense, you have to make the politics make sense, too.","[politics, kings, you]",science
17,David Chalmers,"Even when I was studying mathematics, physics, and computer science, it always seemed that the problem of consciousness was about the most interesting problem out there for science to come to grips with.","[mathematics, problem]",science
18,Joseph Rotblat,But the first the general public learned about the discovery was the news of the destruction of Hiroshima by the atom bomb. A splendid achievement of science and technology had turned malign. Science became identified with death and destruction.,"[death, technology]",science
19,Carl Friedrich Gauss,"Further, the dignity of the science itself seems to require that every possible means be explored for the solution of a problem so elegant and so celebrated.","[problem, solution, possible]",science
20,John Polkinghorne,"I also think we need to maintain distinctions - the doctrine of creation is different from a scientific cosmology, and we should resist the temptation, which sometimes scientists give in to, to try to assimilate the concepts of theology to the concepts of science.","[temptation, creation, think]",science
21,Maya Lin,"I left science, then I went into art, but I approach things very analytically. I choose to pursue both art and architecture as completely separate fields rather than merging them.","[art, architecture, choose]",science
22,Cindy Crawford,I don't think makeup is rocket science or a cure for cancer.,"[makeup, think, cancer]",science
23,Barack Obama,Part of the reason that our politics seems so tough right now and facts and science and argument does not seem to be winning the day all the time is because we're hardwired not to always think clearly when we're scared. And the country's scared.,"[time, politics, winning]",science
24,Vivienne Westwood,Economists treat economics as if it is a pure science divorced from the facts of life. The result of this false accountancy is a willful confusion under cover of which industry wreaks its havoc scot-free and ignores the environmental cost.,"[life, environmental]",science
25,Pierre Bourdieu,"The function of sociology, as of every science, is to reveal that which is hidden.","[hidden, sociology, every]",science
