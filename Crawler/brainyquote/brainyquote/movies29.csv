0,Miranda Cosgrove,"As far as movies, I love 'The Notebook.' I always say that I wish I could play Rachel McAdams' character. She's amazing. That's the movie every girl wants to be in.","[love, character, amazing]",movies
1,Morena Baccarin,"I've love to do more movies. Just because I'm interested in the medium very much. I've done a lot of theatre at this point, and I've done a lot of TV. I've done a few independent films, but a lot of them have not seen the light of day. It'd be really nice to be in a film that gets out there.","[love, light, day]",movies
2,Manny Farber,"'Sunset Boulevard' - the story of Hollywood movies draped on a depressing sex affair - is an uncompromising study of American decadence displaying a sad, worn, methodical beauty few films have had since the late twenties.","[beauty, sad, sunset]",movies
3,Laz Alonso,You may have seen me in movies like 'Fast & Furious' and 'Avatar.' But I wouldn't have been able to do any of that without hard work and determination. You can accomplish anything if you just stay out of trouble and do the right things.,"[work, hard work, me]",movies
4,James Dashner,"When I'm feeling a little empty in the head, I like to go see movies or read to loosen things up there.","[see, feeling, head]",movies
5,Dree Hemingway,"I dream of working with iconic directors such as Tim Burton, Baz Luhrmann, Terry Gilliam and Wes Anderson - so I'm setting my sights pretty high! My perfect role would be in a fairy-tale period piece, and I'm quite upset all the Harry Potter movies have been made as I'd love to have been in those.","[love, perfect, dream]",movies
6,Edith Head,"We don't make glamorous movies today. Everything now is very realistic, artistic - and depressing. When is the last time you you saw a wonderful musical or a fabulous fantasy?","[time, today, you]",movies
7,Jacques Audiard,"For me, there was no great myth around the movies when I was a young child. My father was very simple about the whole thing. He did not consider cinema an art. Cinema was entertainment. Literature and music were art.","[music, art, father]",movies
8,Nikolaj Coster-Waldau,"The only thing I find difficult to watch - horror movies - not that I don't like them. Like 'The Shining,' it's one of my favorite movies, but it's terrifying. I feel like I've watched a marathon afterwards.","[find, difficult, marathon]",movies
9,Jencarlos Canela,"I only respond to Telemundo when it's about novellas, in regards to music or movies they have nothing to do with it; that's mine.","[music, nothing, mine]",movies
10,Polly Bergen,"I came to Southbury because I wanted to live a more simple life. When I was a child, I saw lots of movies about happy people living in Connecticut. And ever since then, that was where I wanted to live. I thought it would be like the movies. And it really is. It's exactly what I hoped it would be.","[life, happy, simple]",movies
11,Gabriel Iglesias,"Comedians do movies and TV so that when they tour, they sell out. That's the goal: To get popular enough so the place is packed.","[goal, place, sell]",movies
12,Alan Ball,"I'm aware of 'Twilight,' but I've never seen the movies or read any of the books. Frankly, the story leaves me cold - why do a vampire story about abstinence?","[me, story, cold]",movies
13,Darren Aronofsky,"It would be nice to make a movie that other people want to make, because every one of these movies, I basically have to find the only company in the world that's willing to make it, and it's always a big challenge. I end up spending a tremendous amount of energy and time trying to get money to make these movies and it's exhausting.","[time, money, end]",movies
14,Alfonso Cuaron,"If I would rescue one of my movies, it would be 'A Little Princess.'","[princess, rescue, little]",movies
15,Alfonso Cuaron,"It's a cliche, but Americans are puritanical. In their movies, they are scared of sex, but they overindulge in violence. I could have cut a G-rated version of 'Y Tu Mama Tambien' that would have pleased the American ratings board, but it would have been five minutes long.","[violence, american, sex]",movies
16,Dan Aykroyd,"You know, I've sold a lot of bad movies in my time.","[time, know, you]",movies
17,Afrika Bambaataa,"I'm fanatical about movies: African, European, Viking, Roman. I got into witchcraft and magic from watching 'Bewitched' and 'The Wizard of Oz,' which shows in some of my outfits. I dress to reflect the whole spectrum of the universe.","[universe, dress, magic]",movies
18,Jesse McCartney,"I used to watch every episode of 'Justice League,' I went to all the movies, I had the Superman lunchbox. I was enamored with animation in general and always wanted to somehow be a part of it.","[justice, superman, animation]",movies
19,Denis Leary,"The thing with movies is, because you have so little time, I always feel like there are more things we could've done with the character. If we'd done a sequel to 'The Thomas Crown Affair,' what would that have been like? But for the most part, you try not to think of that, because it's just going to break your heart.","[time, character, heart]",movies
20,Denis Leary,"When I go to Batman movies, I always think, 'Man, I would like to be a bad guy in a Batman movie.' especially as they got darker when they go to the Christian Bale era.","[man, christian, think]",movies
21,Kirsten Dunst,"If I saw 'Virgin Suicides' or 'Eternal Sunshine,' I'm so proud to be in those movies. They are such great movies. I felt so free on those sets.","[great, sunshine, proud]",movies
22,Ezekiel Emanuel,"Where I came from, just nodding and smiling when someone expressed views was the ultimate insult. If people weren't yelling about politics in our house then they were arguing about music, or movies, or food.","[music, food, politics]",movies
23,Tina Fey,I feel like it's harder to get women to show up for movies.,"[women, feel, i feel like]",movies
24,Kristy McNichol,"My mother always wanted to be an actress. She was an extra in movies and stuff. I have a feeling this is the classic story: The mother wants to be an actress, and the child ends up doing it. But it was never a jealousy thing between us. It was like - well, I was making my mom happy.","[mom, happy, mother]",movies
25,Norman Reedus,"Oh I love horror movies, yeah. I think my favorite movie growing up was 'The Omen.' I actually wanted to be that little kid.","[love, growing up, think]",movies
