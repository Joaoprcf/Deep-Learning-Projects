3,Donald Norman,I prefer design by experts - by people who know what they are doing.,"[people, doing, know]",design
4,Chris Benz,"I'd call my work 'instinctual design.' I like to find the spirit of a piece that defies time, age, and occasion. My clothes give the wearer the chance to develop their own voice within a wardrobe, and I think of them as curators of their personal style.","[work, time, age]",design
5,Chris Roberson,"A big part of the fun of working on Superman has been coming up with new characters and concepts to toss in, helping to design their costumes, things like that. And I spent ages coming up with the name 'Fortress of Solidarity,' so I want to get as much use out of it as I can!","[fun, superman, want]",design
6,Corin Nemec,"Stargate by far is the top of the pile when it comes to Sci-Fi. The quality is great. They have really good writers, production design, lighting, wardrobe.","[good, great, quality]",design
7,John Slattery,"As an actor, you see a sliver of how the show is made, but to see the actual writing process and the re-writing process and the casting process and art direction and set design - all of this is happening in a very intense period.","[art, writing, direction]",design
8,Hasso Plattner,"At Stanford, we teach 'design thinking' - that is, we put together small, interdisciplinary groups to figure out what the true needs are and then to apply the art of engineering to serve them.","[art, together, thinking]",design
9,Christopher Alexander,Complexity is one of the great problems in environmental design.,"[environmental, great]",design
10,Luca Cordero di Montezemolo,"'LaFerrari' means 'the Ferrari.' The excellence. In this car, we put everything we are able to do. Our extreme technology, extreme experience, extreme capability. And this has been the first Ferrari totally designed in our design center.","[technology, experience, car]",design
11,Kenneth R. Miller,"The scientific argument advanced for intelligent design at the Dover trial, those arguments collapsed, scientifically and intellectually.","[intelligent, argument]",design
12,Kenneth R. Miller,"The argument for intelligent design basically depends on saying, 'You haven't answered every question with evolution,'... Well, guess what? Science can't answer every question.","[science, intelligent]",design
13,Kenneth R. Miller,The new strategy is to teach intelligent design without calling it intelligent design.,"[strategy, intelligent, teach]",design
14,Christopher Alexander,"Once you understand this way, you will be able to make your room alive; you will be able to design a house together with your family; a garden for your children; places where you can work; beautiful terraces where you can sit and dream.","[family, work, children]",design
15,Kenneth R. Miller,"Like many other scientists who hold the Catholic faith, I see the Creator's plan and purpose fulfilled in our universe. I see a planet bursting with evolutionary possibilities, a continuing creation in which the Divine providence is manifest in every living thing. I see a science that tells us there is indeed a design to life.","[life, science, faith]",design
16,Kenneth R. Miller,"'Intelligent Design,' the relabeled, repackaged form of American creationism, has always had a problem. It just can't seem to produce any evidence.","[american, problem]",design

18,John Logan,"I couldn't write a happy movie or romantic comedy to save my life. Yes, Noel Coward's an idol, but his plays are serious to me. 'Private Lives' and 'Design for Living' both have an edge. Without psychoanalyzing myself, I think I exorcise my demons in my work.","[life, work, romantic]",design
19,Thomas J. Watson,Design must reflect the practical and aesthetic in business but above all... good design must primarily serve people.,"[business, good, people]",design
20,David Benioff,"If you're writing a screenplay for a feature, you don't have any involvement with the casting process, the editing process, the set design, the costume design, or any of that stuff.","[writing, process]",design
21,Jay Roach,"I do love DVD and I've always taken them seriously. You know, on the Austin things, we really put a ton of work into them because there's so much design involved. And in this one, we thought a lot about it and what could go in.","[love, work, thought]",design
22,Jay Roach,My biggest role as director on the film is keeping a sense of the overview - how to cast the movie and shoot it in such a way that it will cut together. And how to design the style and tone.,"[together, style, way]",design

24,Zedd,"I always take care to have interesting chord progressions, because you can have the best sound design in the club, and you'll kill it in the club, but in five years, kids will have better sound design. But if your music is good, you'll always be able to listen to it, even in 20 or 50 years.","[music, best, good]",design
25,Nicolle Wallace,"I was very much inspired by the things that I'd seen and done in politics, but I was also desperate for a complete departure from the reality of my political experience. 'It's Classified' and my previous book 'Eighteen Acres' are both works of fiction, but if they do seem realistic, it's by design.","[experience, politics, book]",design
