0,Mary Roach,"If you could really guarantee that the money would be spent on something more worthwhile, I'd say, absolutely, scrap the space program, but it never works that way.","[money, way, you]",space
1,Tim Armstrong,Bebo has an opportunity to prove its products and services. Bebo plays in a very competitive space; it has big market share in specific countries. An AIM profile vs. a Bebo profile are very different experiences.,"[opportunity, aim, big]",space
2,Kevin A. Ford,We spend our spare time taking care of little things. I can watch a little bit of college and professional football if I want to... Our favorite pastime is trying to take pictures of our hometowns from space.,"[time, college, football]",space
3,Neil deGrasse Tyson,"Private enterprise can never lead a space frontier. It's not possible because a space frontier is expensive, it has unknown risks and it has unquantified risks.","[unknown, risks, possible]",space
4,Tariq Ramadan,"Religious symbols should be visible in public space, in a dignified and non-provocative manner. Christmas trees here, Jewish menorahs there and, further along, a minaret - these symbols represent human life in all its diversity.","[christmas, life, diversity]",space
5,Tabitha King,"Writing is always a restorative process. It's like paddling a kayak. When you're writing, you can't do anything else. You're in the space you're in. So, in that way, it's enormously centering and restorative.","[writing, process, way]",space
6,Dave Gahan,I go to a very visual place when I'm singing. It's very cinematic and I get this feeling of space. I love when music does that.,"[love, music, singing]",space
7,Amaury Nolasco,These displays of affection mean a lot to our family and are a reminder of the heart that my people have. In this time of grief we ask for a little privacy and space to digest this news; our sister was our sun and we are broken by her departure.,"[family, time, sister]",space
8,Gore Verbinski,"It's a mistake for Hollywood to impose themselves on the gaming space. Not only is it arrogant, but it hasn't really worked.","[mistake, gaming, hollywood]",space

10,Zaha Hadid,Obviously for some people there is a big connection between music and the way you can create a space.,"[music, people, way]",space
11,Ben Parr,The big reason why we don't have space colonies and regular trips to the moon is that flying into outer space is just plain 'hard.' The business of safely transporting people off the Earth is a costly affair that requires a lot of technology.,"[technology, business, moon]",space
12,Jermain Defoe,"I had to tell Dad, 'It will be okay and be positive; keep praying and have faith'. I have always known about cancer, but to be around someone who has it and to see what it does in such a short space of time was hard. It makes you think about your life, about what is important.","[life, positive, time]",space
13,Jesse Williams,"I'm kind of in a middle space, being marketed as a biracial actor. Roles are written either stereotypically black, or they're written 'normal,' which is just code for white.","[black, actor, kind]",space
14,Rufus Wainwright,"When I wrote the opera, I made a deal with myself that for at least an hour a day I would work on it, even if it meant just sitting on my piano bench, staring into space and thinking about it. It's about keeping it regular, like your bowel movements - let's get real: it's your bodily artistic movements! It comes from the same place.","[work, myself, day]",space
15,Sarah Brightman,"I was born in 1960, and space theory, especially in the last part of that time and going into the '70s, space was very relevant at that time. It was on television - all the experiments, the moon landings, everything like that.","[time, moon, television]",space

18,Lea Salonga,"I was 28, and my mom was living with me. I had to decide. You have to claim it; you can't ask permission. After a gig in Singapore, she went home, I went to New York on my own, I packed her stuff in boxes and sent it home. I don't think she liked me for a while for doing that. It was something I needed to do to carve out my own space.","[home, mom, me]",space
19,Niecy Nash,"There's nothing wrong with having a collection, but it becomes a problem when it overwhelms your space. When you're not displaying it properly, you're not enjoying it and it turns into clutter.","[problem, nothing, you]",space
20,Ian Anderson,"I think we always view people who make us feel uncomfortable and appear to intrude on our middle-class cozy space, we view them with, if not hostility, at least suspicion, discomfort, embarrassment.","[people, think, uncomfortable]",space
21,Buzz Aldrin,"Going back to the moon is not visionary in restoring space leadership for America. Like its Apollo predecessor, it will prove to be a dead end littered with broken spacecraft, broken dreams and broken policies.","[leadership, dreams, end]",space
22,Buzz Aldrin,"Retain the vision for space exploration. If we turn our backs on the vision again, we're going to have to live in a secondary position in human space flight for the rest of the century.","[vision, live, rest]",space
23,Buzz Aldrin,"I came to dedicate my life to opening space to the average person and crafting designs for new spaceships that could take us far from home. But since Apollo ended, such travels were only in our collective memory.","[life, home, memory]",space
24,Padmasree Warrior,"I think the adoption rate with respect to social media and how companies leverage that varies by the company. Cisco is probably a leader in the space. A lot of times, we actually use virtual ways to communicate our brand and do some of our advertising, first on the social space, then we do on physical advertising.","[respect, social media, media]",space
25,Brian Blessed,"I've completed half of my space training at Space City in Moscow. I love adventure, and I've been training in a centrifuge and MiG Fighter with a view to going into space and being a spokesman for space exploration!","[love, adventure, training]",space
