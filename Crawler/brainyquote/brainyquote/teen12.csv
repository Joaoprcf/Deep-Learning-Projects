3,Lady Starlight,"As a unique person, I was bullied badly as a teen.","[unique, person, bullied]",teen
4,Chris Massoglia,"I don't really think I feel pressured to become a teen sensation because that's not really my goal in life. It's not really about being star, being popular or having lots of girls. It's really about continuing to be able to act and have fun, and do what I like to do.","[life, goal, fun]",teen
5,Paul Butcher,"I do a lot of teen shows and voice over work for animation, so when I got the part in 'The Number 23,' it was really cool because now I get to be in a movie with Jim Carrey. Acting in this movie was really a learning experience for me.","[work, learning, experience]",teen
6,Chelsea Kane,"I think if we were going to worry about teen pregnancy being glamorized, we should worry about shows like 'Teen Mom'. If people are going to want to have children at a young age because they see it on TV, I think that depends on the type of person you're dealing with.","[age, mom, children]",teen
7,Nancy Werlin,I actually hope people don't react to 'Impossible' in a way where they think it's terribly retro. The plot needed to do what it needed to do. But I'm a little surprised to find myself looking a little bit like an advocate of teen marriage. It takes some exceptional circumstances for that to be a reasonable idea.,"[hope, marriage, myself]",teen
8,Johnny Otis,"When I got near teen age, I was so happy with my friends and the African-American culture that I couldn't imagine not being part of it.","[age, happy, culture]",teen
9,Shanley Caswell,"When I was a freshman, I didn't have that much time for extra-curriculars, so I didn't do any theater stuff. Actually, I didn't do it with my school. I did theater with this thing called Teen Source.","[time, school, theater]",teen
10,Jeremy Shada,"I grew up watching a lot of stuff, like 'Teen Titans.'","[watching, like, up]",teen
11,Carolyn Mackler,My own experience being bullied - it made me a more compassionate person. It made me more sympathetic to the adolescent experience.,"[experience, me, my own]",teen
12,Ally Carter,"Teenage girls read in packs. It's true today, and it was true when I was a teen growing up in a small town in northeast Oklahoma.","[today, small, growing up]",teen
13,Keahu Kahuanui,"A departure from the movie with Michael J. Fox, 'Teen Wolf' tells the story of how a group of angsty teens deal with werewolves, their supernatural kin and the world of trouble that comes with it, all while trying to still live their lives.","[world, trying, wolf]",teen
14,Nancy Garden,"My writing books with positive gay characters has come more out of anger than anything else: anger at not having been able to find honest, accurate books about people like myself as a teen, books that show we're as diverse as straight people and that we can lead happy, healthy, productive lives just as straight people can.","[positive, happy, myself]",teen
15,Ben Lindsey,"Trouble is, kids feel they have to shock their elders and each generation grows up into something harder to shock.","[generation, feel, trouble]",teen
16,Kerr Smith,It hasn't been until the last couple years that I've started playing close to my age. But it's fun playing the younger roles because it takes you back to the teen years.,"[age, fun, you]",teen
17,Robyn Lively,"This is actually something no one knows, but my mom was really the one who created the entire style for 'Teen Witch.' I'm dead serious. She was super involved, and is super creative, so I wore a lot of my actual clothes in the movie. Truly, Louise was my mom's vision. She really created an iconic character.","[mom, character, vision]",teen
18,Robyn Lively,"Because of people like that guy in San Francisco who told me it changed his life, 'Teen Witch' is my most favorite thing I've ever done. I see how happy it makes people, and that makes me happy. The great thing is that no one realized it was going to become all these things when we were making it. We thought we were making a very serious movie.","[life, happy, great]",teen
19,Robyn Lively,My younger sister and younger brother are huge 'Teen Witch' fans.,"[sister, brother, fans]",teen
20,Robyn Lively,"This is actually something no one knows, but my mom was really the one who created the entire style for 'Teen Witch.' I'm dead serious.","[mom, style, serious]",teen
21,Lili Simmons,I think teen girls will like 'Geek Charming' because they really focus on the 'populars' and nerdy people and people who are in between the nerds and between the populars. So it really hits every category of what girls are going through in high school.,"[school, focus, people]",teen
22,Lili Simmons,"There's an indie movie I did called 'Fat Kid Rules the World,' which was based on a teen book, and it's a fabulous story, and hopefully it'll go to theaters because it is an amazing story.","[book, amazing, world]",teen
23,Aeriel Miranda,"'Pretty Little Liars,' you know, it's a teen show that grew to be something bigger. I think you had girls from ages 7 to, like, 20 watching the show, and that was the predominant audience. Then it grew to be for girls, boys, men, women, people who are 7 to 35. I think that's crazy.","[women, men, crazy]",teen
24,Charlie Carver,The 'Teen Wolf' fans are so great.,"[great, wolf, fans]",teen
25,Cory Wells,"I was a big fan of black gospel. As a kid, there were black groups I sang with from my teen years to my early 20s.","[black, early, big]",teen
