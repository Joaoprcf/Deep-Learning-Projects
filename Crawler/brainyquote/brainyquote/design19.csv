2,Bill Gates,The typical project design time for a large company like IBM - and they keep track of this - is a little over four years.,"[time, company, project]",design
3,Richard Dawkins,"The universe we observe has precisely the properties we should expect if there is, at bottom, no design, no purpose, no evil, no good, nothing but blind, pitiless indifference.","[good, evil, universe]",design

7,Steve Jobs,"The design of the Mac wasn't what it looked like, although that was part of it. Primarily, it was how it worked. To design something really well, you have to get it. You have to really grok what it's all about. It takes a passionate commitment to really thoroughly understand something, chew it up, not just quickly swallow it.","[commitment, passionate, you]",design
8,Stephen Hawking,"As Irving Good realised in 1965, machines with superhuman intelligence could repeatedly improve their design even further, triggering what Vernor Vinge called a 'singularity.'","[good, intelligence, improve]",design
9,Stephen Hawking,"It was Einstein's dream to discover the grand design of the universe, a single theory that explains everything. However, physicists in Einstein's day hadn't made enough progress in understanding the forces of nature for that to be a realistic goal.","[nature, progress, goal]",design

11,Elon Musk,There are really two things that have to occur in order for a new technology to be affordable to the mass market. One is you need economies of scale. The other is you need to iterate on the design. You need to go through a few versions.,"[technology, you, new]",design
12,Elon Musk,So we originally expected to make about 35 gigawatt hours at the cell level and about 50 gigawatt hours at the module or pack level. Now we are expecting to do about 150 gigawatt hours in the same volumetric space as the original design.,"[space, original, same]",design
13,Tyra Banks,"Designers are very fickle. I never wanted to be a victim of that. You're in one minute, out the next.","[victim, you, never]",design
14,Brian Eno,"If you want to make computers that really work, create a design team composed only of healthy, active women with lots else to do in their lives, and give them carte blanche.","[work, women, team]",design

16,Ben Bernanke,Economic engineering is about the design and analysis of frameworks for achieving specific economic objectives.,"[achieving, engineering]",design
17,Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu,"I have a notebook, and I know what decisions will be made in pre-production. Everything is pre-determined in the pre-production period. I visually design the whole thing, and I know when things will happen.","[decisions, know, happen]",design
18,Seth Shostak,"Most of the things at the zoo don't look like us. We're one design that works. Our chimp pals sort of look like us, so that's a different take on the same basic design. But fish don't look like us, and giraffes don't. They look a little like us, but not too much. And insects certainly don't look like us, and they work just fine.","[work, fish, look]",design

22,Jason Statham,"There's so many interesting aspects of making a movie: the costume department, the set design, the casting itself, the locations.","[interesting, many, costume]",design
23,Craig Venter,"Genome design is going to be a key part of the future. That's why we need fast, cheap, accurate DNA synthesis, so you can make a lot of iterations of something and test them.","[future, science, you]",design
24,Craig Venter,"When you think of all the things that are made from oil or in the chemical industry, if in the future we could find cells to replace most of those processes, the ideal way would be to do it by direct design.","[future, find, think]",design
25,Craig Venter,Genetic design is something we can use to fight the lack of sustainability we humans are forcing on the earth's environment.,"[environment, fight, earth]",design
