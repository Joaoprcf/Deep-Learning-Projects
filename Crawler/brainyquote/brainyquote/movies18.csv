0,Chuck Palahniuk,"A big reason why I started writing is I felt that fiction had stopped evolving. All other entertainments were getting better, constantly, as technology allowed. Movies. Video games. Music.","[music, technology, writing]",movies
1,Virginia Postrel,"The elements that create glamour are not specific styles - bias-cut gowns or lacquered furniture - but more general qualities: grace, mystery, transcendence. To the right audience, Halle Berry is more glamorous commanding the elements as Storm in the X-Men movies than she is walking the red carpet in a designer gown.","[storm, walking, grace]",movies
2,Martin Rees,"Post-human intelligence will develop hypercomputers with the processing power to simulate living things - even entire worlds. Perhaps advanced beings could use hypercomputers to surpass the best 'special effects' in movies or computer games so vastly that they could simulate a world, fully, as complex as the one we perceive ourselves to be in.","[best, power, intelligence]",movies
3,Scott M. Gimple,"It's gonna be weird how there are going to be new 'Star Wars' movies every year starting in 2015. I don't know what that's going to be like, having one every year. Maybe it'll be perfect. Maybe it'll be just the right amount of time to have something to look forward to. Maybe it'll be too many at once.","[time, year, perfect]",movies
4,David Call,"Movies are such an integral part of American culture. We're so spread out in this country, and movies offer us a chance to come together and have a communal experience.","[experience, culture]",movies
5,Ivana Milicevic,'The Princess Bride' is one of my favorite movies of all time.,"[time, princess, bride]",movies
6,Tabatha Coffey,"I've always had a thing for old movies, old Hollywood. I've always just loved watching Marilyn Monroe and Greta Garbo. In all of those old movies from the '40s and '50s, women put themselves together so well, with a little bit of drama and elegance. That was fascinating to me growing up.","[women, together, growing up]",movies
7,Andrew Lau,"I still remember 1997 when I made the movie 'Storm Riders;' that moment, a lot of American producers want to hire me to make movies in the States.","[storm, american, moment]",movies
8,Fede Alvarez,"'Evil Dead' was such a big movie in my life. It's one of the few that I really remember when I watched it for the first time. I mean, I don't remember when I first saw 'The Empire Strikes Back,' and it's one of my favourite movies.","[life, time, evil]",movies
9,Ridley Scott,"I always shoot my movies with score as certainly part of the dialogue. Music is dialogue. People don't think about it that way, but music is actually dialogue. And sometimes music is the final, finished, additional dialogue. Music can be one of the final characters in the film.","[music, people, think]",movies
10,Elizabeth Banks,"Predicting what content is going to fly is like looking into a crystal ball. I try not to say, 'Yeah, 'Bridesmaids' opened the door to make more movies about women.' I mean, did it? I don't know; where are they?","[women, door, looking]",movies
11,Allison Anders,You still get the movies made. A filmmaker can always scrape up money to do a movie. The passion drives it. And you'll get the money. Money's the easiest thing. But the hardest thing is finding a way for people to see your movie.,"[money, passion, people]",movies
12,Holly Black,"Inspiration comes from everywhere. From life, observing people, etc. From movies and books you love. From research.","[life, love, research]",movies
13,Jane Greer,"I love making movies, but I was ready to rationalize being only a mother if my career never got back on track.","[love, mother, career]",movies
14,Dwayne Johnson,"Before ever meeting Priyanka Chopra, I had heard her name coming out of Bollywood and was impressed: she was beautiful, talented, had made nearly 50 movies, earned multiple awards - a massive star.","[beautiful, meeting, she]",movies
15,Kevin Costner,"I'm glad movies aren't going to please everybody, they can't. But what they have to be is recognisable. I don't equate myself with a master painter, but I think you can recognise my films.","[myself, think, you]",movies
16,Margot Kidder,"We didn't have movies in this little mining town. When I was 12 my mom took me to New York and I saw Bye Bye Birdie, with people singing and dancing, and that was it.","[mom, people, me]",movies
17,Ben Affleck,"I kinda see my current position like this: Here's your five minutes in the toy store, so you gotta do all the good movies you can before 'Chuck Woolery' rings the bell.","[good, see, you]",movies
18,Kristen Stewart,I had to act in a school play when I was about ten years old. I really didn't want to do it. But everyone had to do it so I didn't have a choice. A talent agent came and watched it and later gave me some work. It's funny because I'd always known that I wanted a movie career. I just didn't think that I would be in the movies.,"[funny, work, school]",movies
19,Denzel Washington,"It's simple: You get a part. You play a part. You play it well. You do your work and you go home. And what is wonderful about movies is that once they're done, they belong to the people. Once you make it, it's what they see. That's where my head is at.","[work, home, simple]",movies
20,Cam Newton,My place of refuge is definitely watching movies and playing video games. I know that's kind of hard to fathom.,"[video games, know, place]",movies
21,Akon,"I love to just go to the movies, watch movies, listen to the scores and all that 'cause that's, like, the next step for me.","[love, me, step]",movies
22,Tony Jaa,"After doing a bunch of movies as a stuntman, I realized that being a stuntman, you are in the shadow of the actor, and they don't get to see your true ability, and I wanted people to see that it was really me doing those stunts, and it was really my true abilities.","[people, me, shadow]",movies
23,Robert Gottlieb,"'Black Swan' does what Hollywood movies have always done - it spends its energies on getting some surface things right while getting everything important wrong. Darren Aronofsky, the director, applies the same techniques and the same sensibility here as he did with 'The Wrestler,' only with a prettier protagonist.","[black, important, hollywood]",movies
24,Jodie Foster,"I don't make movies because I love to act. I make movies because I like to make movies, and I like to be a part of that process.","[love, process, act]",movies
25,Alfred Hitchcock,The length of a film should be directly related to the endurance of the human bladder.,"[endurance, film, human]",movies
