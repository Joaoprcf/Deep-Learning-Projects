0,Christa McAuliffe,I can remember in early elementary school when the Russians launched the first satellite. There was still so much unknown about space. People thought Mars was probably populated.,"[school, people, thought]",space
1,Jasper Johns,Most of the power of painting comes through the manipulation of space... but I don't understand that.,"[power, painting]",space
2,Jasper Johns,"One likes to think that one anticipates changes in the spaces we inhabit, and our ideas about space.","[ideas, changes, think]",space

6,W. D. Richter,Why not a space flower? Why do we always expect metal ships?,"[flower, metal, expect]",space
7,Busta Rhymes,I feel like the quality of privacy and respect of people's personal space has been completely disintegrated. You can ask to take the picture. I will be so glad to take the picture and pose and look good for the picture.,"[respect, good, quality]",space
8,Bill Nye,"Everyone, red state, blue state, everyone supports space exploration.","[blue, red, exploration]",space
9,Jennifer Granholm,"When someone lives as a minority, they experience the world differently than those of us who live in the majority. We may occupy the same physical space, but we don't occupy the same psychic space.","[experience, world, live]",space
10,Joseph Gordon-Levitt,"I mean, movies in general tend to sort of portray time, space and identity as these very solid things. Time moves forward. Space is what it is. You are you, and you're always you.","[time, identity, forward]",space
11,Melissa Rosenberg,"Everyone is given one gift, a reason for being, and it's our obligation to do something with it. Obviously, it's a challenge - but if you're not taking the bull by the horns, I have no patience for you. You're just taking up space.","[patience, gift, challenge]",space
12,Evan Davis,"Most people hugely underestimate the amount of 'empty space' we have in our country. Fly over the U.K., and you see that human settlement does not fill up the U.K. at all. It accounts for something of the order of 15 per cent of the landmass.","[people, fly, underestimate]",space
13,Seth Gordon,"A favorite film of mine is 'Office Space' and I love 'The Hangover.' That is a really good comedy from character in that film, and that is true of 'Office Space' too.","[love, good, character]",space
14,Thomas Marshburn,"When we're on the space station, we orbit the Earth 16 times per day, which means we're constantly moving to and away from the sun. From light to shadow, the temperature swings by 300 degrees. Of course we're protected by the gear we wear, but you can definitely feel this temperature change.","[change, light, day]",space
15,Peter Diamandis,"Back in 2007, I had the opportunity to meet Professor Stephen Hawking through the X PRIZE Foundation. In my first conversation with him I learned that he was passionate about flying into space someday.","[opportunity, foundation]",space
16,Jerry Saltz,"Can space break? I mean the space of art galleries. Over the past 100 years, art galleries have gone from looking like Beaux Arts salons to simple storefronts to industrial lofts to the gleaming giant white cubes of Chelsea with their shiny concrete floors.","[art, past, simple]",space
17,Jerry Saltz,"New Yorkers only cross water for visual culture if the water is an ocean. The East River throws us for a huge loop. If we started going to Queens and the Bronx for visual culture, many of our rent, space, and crowding problems would be over indefinitely.","[culture, water, ocean]",space
18,Kal Penn,"What I love about L.A. and Washington, D.C. is that they're almost the opposite of each other. L.A. is a very creative space while D.C. is a very cerebral space. So, they're the ying and the yang in my world. I like them both for their own reasons.","[love, world, creative]",space

21,Ray LaMontagne,I need space between me and the audience - and the more space the better.,"[me, better, audience]",space
22,Paul Davies,"Perhaps the best motivation for going to Mars is political. It is obvious that no single nation currently has either the will or the resources to do it alone, but a consortium of nations and space agencies could achieve it within 20 years.","[best, alone, motivation]",space
23,Burt Rutan,"In the coming era of manned space exploration by the private sector, market forces will spur development and yield new, low-cost space technologies. If the history of private aviation is any guide, private development efforts will be safer, too.","[history, development]",space
24,Tom Hodgkinson,"When we are busy at work and busy at home, an hour's walking every day becomes a real luxury. If done alone, the walk injects a period of meditation into the day, and if done in company, it allows space for some really good conversation.","[work, home, good]",space
25,Rebecca Solnit,"We talk about politicians being in public life, but they seldom appear in the public space where everyone is free to appear as a citizen.","[life, free, everyone]",space
