3,Jane Siberry,"I tour alone. There's no sound check, no back up. I stay with the hosts; I am in a family home and it's really nourishing.

7,Edward Hoagland,"Black bears, though, are not fearsome. I encountered one on the road to my house in Vermont, alone at night. I picked up two stones just in case, but I wasn't afraid of him. I felt a hunter's exhilaration and a brotherly feeling.","[road, black, night]",alone

14,Amy Chua,"There's something suspicious about saying, 'I'm just going to leave my child alone and let her pursue her passions.' You know what?

16,Nawal El Saadawi,"A lot of women are afraid of loneliness, so when they see a woman who can live alone, then they think, 'Hmm, I can do that.' But you need an example, and that is why I am proud to say I have divorced three husbands.","[women, loneliness, woman]",alone
17,Neil deGrasse Tyson,"The universe is almost 14 billion years old, and, wow! Life had no problem starting here on Earth! I think it would be inexcusably egocentric of us to suggest that we're alone in the universe.","[life, universe, problem]",alone
18,Vilayanur S. Ramachandran,"If there is anything about your 'self' of which you can be sure, it is that it is anchored in your own body and yours alone. The person you experience as 'you' is here and now and nowhere else.","[experience, self, body]",alone

24,Max Thieriot,"I don't like going to dinner by myself; I'll call for delivery before I do that. It's awkward if you're at a table all alone. I'm sure nobody even notices, but there's something about it.","[myself, dinner, you]",alone
25,Ayaan Hirsi Ali,"Unlike the United Kingdom or the Commonwealth, the umma, or Muslim community, has no symbolic leader, let alone a formal one.","[community, leader, united]",alone
