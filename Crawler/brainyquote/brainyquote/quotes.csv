I just watch what they do.,Just remember, once you're over the hill you begin to pick up speed.,There is a plan and a purpose, a value to every life, no matter what its location, age, gender or disability.,My life, I realize suddenly, is July.

He lived to a very old age, and so did my mother. I believe that I just have it from my father, from my parents. They had wonderful energy.,Age is something that doesn't matter, unless you are a cheese.,Age should not have its face lifted, but it should rather teach the world to admire wrinkles as the etchings of experience and the firm line of character.,We have been so successful in the past century at the art of living longer and staying alive that we have forgotten how to die.
