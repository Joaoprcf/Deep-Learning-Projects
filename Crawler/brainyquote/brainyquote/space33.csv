0,Buzz Aldrin,"Absolutely the United States should lead in space, for the survival of the United States. It's inspiring for the next generation. If we lose leadership, then we'll be using Chinese capability to inspire Americans.","[leadership, generation]",space
1,Neill Blomkamp,"I think that 'Elysium' the movie is unrealistic, with the space station and everything. I think 'Elysium' the metaphor is completely realistic: it's exactly where we're going.","[think, everything, metaphor]",space
2,Francoise Gilot,"I don't write diaries and things like that, but I have a fantastic memory. I call that like a magic carpet. I can really concentrate and travel back in the past I don't know how many years from now and evoke that space if I wanted.","[travel, past, memory]",space
3,Kid Rock,I take the invasion of my personal space very seriously.,"[seriously, personal]",space
4,Chuck Close,"Painting is a lie. It's the most magic of all media, the most transcendent. It makes space where there is no space.","[media, magic, painting]",space
5,Trent Reznor,"When I return to the writing process after being away from it for a while, the first part of it always is being honest with myself: What am I into right now? Is it rock bands and guitars, is it noise, is it dance beats and electronics? Is it space, is it clutter?","[myself, dance, writing]",space
6,Mohamed ElBaradei,"Young Egyptians, gazing through the windows of the Internet, have gained a keener sense than many of their elders of the freedoms and opportunities they lack. They have found in social media a way to interact and share ideas, bypassing, in virtual space, the restrictions placed on physical freedom of assembly.","[freedom, social media, media]",space
7,Mike Nichols,"The reason that most British actors are better than most American actors in the end is that they don't make any money. At the very end of their lives, they get into a space movie and they make a lot of money, but until that happens, basically, they don't have bank accounts. They live from day to day.","[money, end, day]",space
8,Cindy Sherman,"I had to redo my last house after the pipes burst, and something was lost in the renovation. The soul of the old space was compromised.","[soul, lost, something]",space
9,Diana Nyad,"About the 50th hour, I was going to start thinking about the edge of the universe. Is there an edge? Is this an envelope we're living inside of, or no, does it go onto infinity in both time and space? And there's nothing like swimming for 50 hours in the ocean that gets you thinking about things like this.","[time, ocean, thinking]",space
10,Thomas P.M. Barnett,"There is no battle space the U.S. Military cannot access. They said we couldn't do Afghanistan. We did it with ease. They said we couldn't do Iraq. We did it with 150 combat casualties in six weeks. We did it so fast we weren't prepared for their collapse. There is nobody we can't take down. The question is, what do you do with the power?","[power, battle, said]",space
11,Martin Rees,"Manned spaceflight has lost its glamour - understandably so, because it hardly seems inspiring, 40 years after Apollo, for astronauts merely to circle the Earth in the space shuttle and the International Space Station.","[earth, lost, circle]",space
12,Martin Rees,"It is foolish to claim, as some do, that emigration into space offers a long-term escape from Earth's problems. Nowhere in our solar system offers an environment even as clement as the Antarctic or the top of Everest.","[environment, problems, earth]",space
13,Martin Rees,"Most theorists suspect that space has an intricate structure - that it is 'grainy' - but that this structure is on a much finer scale than any known subatomic particle. The structure could be of an exotic kind: extra dimensions, over and above the three that we are used to (up and down, backward and forward, left and right).","[forward, down, structure]",space
14,Martin Rees,"Not even the most secular among us can fail to be uplifted by Christianity's architectural legacy - the great cathedrals. These immense and glorious buildings were erected in an era of constricted horizons, both in time and in space.","[time, great, legacy]",space
15,Martin Rees,"A monkey is unaware that atoms exist. Likewise, our brainpower may not stretch to the deepest aspects of reality. The bedrock nature of space and time, and the structure of our entire universe, may remain 'open frontiers' beyond human grasp.","[time, nature, universe]",space
16,Paul Tonko,"As the U.S. did during the Space Race, we must invest in our businesses and intellect to ensure America leads the clean energy economy of the future. As we all know, the best way to reduce our deficit and bring down our debt is by putting Americans back to work.","[best, work, future]",space
17,Liu Yang,"From day one, I have been told I am no different from the male astronauts. As a pilot, I flew in the sky. Now that I am an astronaut, I will fly in space.","[sky, day, i am]",space
18,Alan G. Poindexter,"Flying in space is risky. It will never be safe, and the best thing we can do is manage those risks. It's important for people, for human beings, to be in space because they're adaptable and because they're not pre-programmed software that can go off and do tasks that are appropriate for machines.","[best, people, flying]",space
19,Sophie Winkleman,"For clothes, I like Anna on Regent's Park Road. Anna Park, who owns it, has an amazing eye for fresh, exciting clothes. I also love Arrogant Cat on Kensington Church Street. Space NK on Duke of York Square for exciting potions. I think I stretch the term 'tester' way beyond its boundaries.","[love, road, amazing]",space
20,Liza Lapira,I like to talk. That's why I can't karaoke in a private room. Those types of shenanigans are only good in a public space.,"[good, why, talk]",space
21,Jill Davis,I don't actually keep the dresses I've worn during other friends' weddings. Closets are small in New York City - I can't be squandering space on bridesmaid dresses.,"[friends, small, city]",space
22,Barry McGee,"Work done illegally outdoors or without permission feels like pure freedom to me. I understand how it can upset many in our society, but in the bigger picture, it is ultimately about freedom. We are living in a time where public space has become a commodity for corporations to control and dictate what is seen and heard.","[work, time, freedom]",space
23,Drew Houston,People do not choose Dropbox because it has this much space or gigabytes. They choose it for the experience.,"[experience, people, choose]",space
24,Steven Hall,"I love books that give you space to climb inside there. And you have to run to keep up in places, and you have to fill in a lot of blanks yourself. So it almost becomes your story.","[love, yourself, story]",space
25,Jenna Morasca,I am always floating around trying to tend to everyone and be free while at the same time enjoying some space.,"[time, i am, trying]",space
