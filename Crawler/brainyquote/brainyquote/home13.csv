0,Lionel Messi,"I've always really just liked football, and I've always devoted a lot of time to it.

I like going out, but you have to know when you can and when you can't.","[time, football, day]",home
1,Lionel Messi,"I've never stopped being Argentine, and I've never wanted to. I feel very proud of being Argentine, even though I left there.

3,Kevin Rudd,"What we have seen in financial markets should bring home to us all that the central organising principle of this 21st century is interdependence.

6,Eric McCormack,"Most people, if you live in a big city, you see some form of schizophrenia every day, and it's always in the form of someone homeless. 'Look at that guy - he's crazy.

11,David Attenborough,"It's coming home to roost over the next 50 years or so. It's not just climate change; it's sheer space, places to grow food for this enormous horde. Either we limit our population growth or the natural world will do it for us, and the natural world is doing it for us right now.","[change, food, growth]",home
12,Michael Crawford,"I'd be totally exhausted by mid-afternoon, and I could barely climb the stairs at home.

I knew something was wrong, but I had no idea what.","[life, man, challenge]",home
13,Chuck Berry,"Rock 'n' roll accepted me and paid me, even though I loved the big bands... I went that way because I wanted a home of my own. I had a family. I had to raise them. Let's don't leave out the economics. No way.","[family, economics, me]",home
14,Grant Achatz,"My home kitchen is airy, with a gas stove, a stainless-steel island table in the center and granite countertops. It's very modest but there's tons of counter space, so you can slap down three or four cutting boards.","[space, kitchen, down]",home

17,Ronda Rousey,"If I could have had everything exactly the way I wanted, this is how I would have written it down.

19,Julian Robertson,"In baseball, you can hit 40 home runs on a single-A-league team and never get paid a thing. But in a hedge fund, you get paid on your batting average. So you go to the worst league you can find, where there's the least competition.","[team, baseball, competition]",home
20,Neil Patrick Harris,"With the Tonys it's a little tricky because a lot of the funnier jokes are more insider, so people watching at home may not get a Julie Taymor reference the way that New Yorkers would.

21,Mark Cuban,"If you think back to the first sporting event you went to, you don't remember the score, you don't remember a home run, you don't remember a dunk. You remember who you were with. Were you with your mom, your dad, your brother, on a date?","[mom, dad, brother]",home
