0,Elizabeth Marshall Thomas,"As far as I'm concerned, I own my dogs as I own my body. My legs are with me when I take a shower, and I feel no shame.

11,Rory Stewart,"As a Scot, I instinctively feel a sympathy towards a culture which is based on generosity. It's very refreshing.

19,Luca Cordero di Montezemolo,"Sonia Gandhi and her husband have always been persons I look at with a lot of respect.
