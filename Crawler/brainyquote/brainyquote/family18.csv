0,J. Michael Straczynski,"For me, growing up in a ridiculously poor family living in dead-end neighborhoods, Superman was a deeply personal icon, one that said you can do anything if you put your mind to it. What he stood for formed the core of who I wanted to be as I grew up, and informed how I view the world and my responsibilities to other people.","[mind, world, people]",family
1,Gloria Estefan,"My family was musical on both sides. My father's family had a famous flautist and a classical pianist.

I used to play songs from the '20s, '30s and '40s in the kitchen for my grandmother.","[father, mother, guitar]",family
2,Steve Harvey,"All I knew growing up was that my father was married to and loved my momma, period. He worked hard, made some money, and put it on the dresser. She spent it on the family, and he went out and earned some more. He taught me the most about love.","[love, money, father]",family
3,Sonia Sotomayor,"The truth is that since childhood I had cultivated an existential independence.

4,Vivica A. Fox,"I don't like to see projects that are all black or all white. It's how life is. I do like to make sure that I do a nice black family film; that's like keeping my home base. I do other things, but I like to always come back to a positive family film, because of all the negative influences today.","[life, positive, home]",family
5,Kendrick Lamar,"My folks ain't graduated from high school or nothing like that, so we always had to struggle in the family - and I come from a big family.","[struggle, school, nothing]",family
6,Jordan Bridges,"The way it works in our family is, it's the family business. Much like in the Mafia. Every child is given the opportunity to act at a young age and to learn what it's like to be in the business.","[business, age, opportunity]",family

9,Pritam Chakraborty,"I don't like talking unnecessarily, and my communication skills are zilch. I just can't converse with people.

13,Billy Williams,"Mobile is a seaport town, and we ate a lot of seafood. We'd go fishing, we'd catch our fish and we'd eat our fish. It was a ritual on Saturday morning for all my family - my grandfather, my brothers, my uncles, my father - to go fishing, and then the ladies of the family would clean the fish and fry them up.","[morning, father, fishing]",family
14,Padmasree Warrior,"I don't like the word 'balance.'

20,Joyce Carol Oates,"When I wrote 'We Were The Mulvaneys,' I was just old enough to look back upon my own family life and the lies of certain individuals close to me, with the detachment of time. I wanted to tell the truth about secrets: How much pain they give, yet how much relief, even happiness we may feel when at last the motive for secrecy has passed.","[life, happiness, time]",family
