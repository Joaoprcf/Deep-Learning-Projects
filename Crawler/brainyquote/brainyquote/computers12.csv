0,Kevin Mitnick,"Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs founded Apple Inc, which set the computing world on its ear with the Macintosh in 1984.","[world, apple, computing]",computers
1,Kevin Mitnick,"It was used for decades to describe talented computer enthusiasts, people whose skill at using computers to solve technical problems and puzzles was - and is - respected and admired by others possessing similar technical skills.","[people, problems, skill]",computers
2,Kevin Mitnick,I get hired to hack into computers now and sometimes it's actually easier than it was years ago.,"[sometimes, now, years]",computers
3,Kevin Mitnick,"I started with CB radio, ham radio, and eventually went into computers. And I was just fascinated with it. And back then, when I was in school, computer hacking was encouraged. It was an encouraged activity. In fact, I remember one of the projects my teacher gave me was writing a log-in simulator.","[teacher, school, writing]",computers
4,Kevin Mitnick,"Use a personal firewall. Configure it to prevent other computers, networks and sites from connecting to you, and specify which programs are allowed to connect to the net automatically.","[you, personal, connect]",computers
5,Mo Ibrahim,"Computers are very expensive and they need power, and that can be a problem in Africa.","[power, problem, africa]",computers
6,Alan Alda,I fix my grandchildren's computers.,"[grandchildren, fix]",computers
7,Douglas Rushkoff,"People are seduced by signals from the world, but that is manipulation, not reality. Computers have learned more about us than we've learned about them.","[world, people, reality]",computers
8,Douglas Rushkoff,"Everyone knows, or should know, that everything we type on our computers or say into our cell phones is being disseminated throughout the datasphere. And most of it is recorded and parsed by big data servers. Why do you think Gmail and Facebook are free? You think they're corporate gifts? We pay with our data.","[free, know, think]",computers
9,Douglas Rushkoff,"The early cyberpunk idea was that networked computers would let us do our work at home, as freelancers, and then transact directly with peers over networks. Digital technology would create tremendous slack, allow us to apply its asynchronous, decentralized qualities to our own work and lives.","[work, technology, home]",computers
10,Douglas Rushkoff,"Not only have computers changed the way we think, they've also discovered what makes humans think - or think we're thinking. At least enough to predict and even influence it.","[thinking, influence, predict]",computers
11,Douglas Rushkoff,"Brains are tricky and adaptable organs. For all the 'neuroplasticity' allowing our brains to reconfigure themselves to the biases of our computers, we are just as neuroplastic in our ability to eventually recover and adapt.","[adapt, brains, ability]",computers
12,Douglas Rushkoff,"The reason why Apple computers have worked so well over time is that, unlike Microsoft, they don't bend over backward to be compatible with every piece of hardware or software in the digital universe. To code or create for Apple, you follow Apple's rules. If you're even allowed to.","[time, universe, rules]",computers
13,Douglas Rushkoff,"Technology has moved away from sharing and toward ownership. This suits software and hardware companies just fine: They create new, bloated programs that require more disk space and processing power. We buy bigger, faster computers, which then require more complex operating systems, and so on.","[technology, power, space]",computers
14,James Comey,"Technology has forever changed the world we live in. We're online, in one way or another, all day long. Our phones and computers have become reflections of our personalities, our interests, and our identities. They hold much that is important to us.","[technology, day, world]",computers
15,Bill Dedman,Companies are accustomed to dismissing employees for misuse of computers at work.,"[work, employees, companies]",computers
16,Marc Jacobs,I wouldn't know how to find eBay on the computer if my life depended on it.,"[life, my life, know]",computers
17,Alan Dershowitz,Juries are not computers. They are composed of human beings who evaluate evidence differently.,"[evidence, human, evaluate]",computers
18,Richard P. Feynman,"Perhaps one day we will have machines that can cope with approximate task descriptions, but in the meantime, we have to be very prissy about how we tell computers to do things.","[day, task, one day]",computers
19,Vint Cerf,"I'm projecting somewhere between 100 million and 200 million computers on the Net by the end of December 2000, and about 300 million users by that same time.","[time, december, end]",computers
20,Vint Cerf,"When I helped to develop the open standards that computers use to communicate with one another across the Net, I hoped for but could not predict how it would blossom and how much human ingenuity it would unleash.","[blossom, predict, human]",computers
21,Jason Calacanis,"The future of television is not on television but online. A majority of us are turning to our computers and mobile devices for news and entertainment, Millennials especially.","[future, television, news]",computers
22,Nathan Myhrvold,"Why pay a fee for Internet content when a million free sites are just a click away? There's no incentive until people are too addicted to the Net to turn off their computers, yet are bored with what's available.","[internet, people, free]",computers
23,Peter Thiel,Every one of today's smartphones has thousands of times more processing power than the computers that guided astronauts to the moon.,"[power, today, moon]",computers
24,Peter Thiel,Men and machines are good at different things. People form plans and make decisions in complicated situations. We are less good at making sense of enormous amounts of data. Computers are exactly the opposite: they excel at efficient data processing but struggle to make basic judgments that would be simple for any human.,"[good, struggle, simple]",computers
25,Satya Nadella,"With all the abundance we have of computers and computing, what is scarce is human attention and time.","[time, attention, abundance]",computers
