2,Ritchie Blackmore,"I was impressed by Hendrix. Not so much by his playing, as his attitude - he wasn't a great player, but everything else about him was brilliant.","[great, everything, him]",attitude
3,Denise Mina,"Even if people do wrong, we're social animals, so what can we do about stopping them doing the same things in future? Saying people are 'bad' or 'evil' is just an unwillingness to engage; an unwillingness to try to empathise. That sanctimonious attitude doesn't help anyone.","[future, evil, help]",attitude
4,Carmen Electra,I went to the Performing Arts School and studied classical ballet. That attitude is something that's put into your head. You are never thin enough.,"[school, ballet, you]",attitude
5,Diane Lane,"I think fun is an important part of the entertainment industry, and it should be. Anybody who's not incorporating some of that into their work needs to take a break, go away, and have an attitude adjustment.","[work, fun, important]",attitude
6,M.I.A.,"At first, I found the music I was making really hard to find a home for. I felt like my attitude was really British, but not the actual sounds I was making. Back in 2003, when I made 'Galang,' there were no clubs that had an 'anything and everything' attitude.","[music, home, find]",attitude
7,Sonakshi Sinha,There are actually no political aspirations. I think you need to have the right attitude and aptitude for it. I don't think I have the right aptitude for it. I think it is unfair to push somebody in that direction just because my father happens to be a politician.,"[father, political, direction]",attitude
8,Shilpa Shetty,"I was always spiritual, even as a child. I was taught to pray, show gratitude. We had an attitude of gratitude. Even if life was ugly, bad or sad - we prayed.","[life, gratitude, sad]",attitude

14,Richard LaGravenese,"How do you survive living in a cell knowing you are innocent? Many of those exonerated whom I have met seem to have a more benign, grateful attitude toward life than those of us who walk free. Many find a religious or spiritual stronghold.","[life, spiritual, grateful]",attitude
15,Clare Balding,Being made to feel like an irrelevant child was probably an asset. Benign negligence is not a bad parental attitude or at least a cross between a benevolent dictator and benign negligence - you should just let kids crack on with it.,"[child, you, bad]",attitude
16,Abhishek Bachchan,I'm not a model; hence I don't see the reason to have a six-pack abs. I can pull off a tough and rugged look of a cop in 'Dhoom' series without taking my shirt off.

17,Walter Gropius,"Theo van Doesburg wanted to teach in the Bauhaus in 1922. I refused, however, to appoint him since I considered him to be too aggressive and too rigidly theoretical: he would have wrought havoc in the Bauhaus through his fanatic attitude, which ran counter to my own broader approach.","[teach, him, van]",attitude
18,James Mercer,"Maybe it's just parenthood that puts you in a situation where you just have to develop a new attitude, I guess, about things.","[situation, you, new]",attitude

21,Eliza Dushku,There is definitely something sexy about a girl with an attitude and a pair of leather pants.,"[girl, sexy, leather]",attitude
22,Marian Keyes,"Regardless of the gender of the highest wage earner, the balance of power in the relationship will suffer if the higher earner uses control of the purse strings as a system of reward and punishment. It will also suffer if the lower earner takes a chippy, haughty attitude to spending money they haven't actually generated themselves.","[relationship, money, power]",attitude
23,Todd Phillips,"There's a punk-rock attitude, clearly, to 'Hated.' There's even a punk-rock attitude to 'The Hangover,' I think. We start the movie with a Glenn Danzig song.","[start, song, think]",attitude

25,Michael Owen,"If you're a goal scorer, you have to have a certain attitude. I'm very serious. My missus thinks I'm a bit weird. I'm cold, I don't have many emotions. It's very rare I cry.","[goal, weird, cold]",attitude
