6,Kristen Stewart,"I mean, I love L.A. - I love living here. But I wish that we could make things without the need to hit a home run every single time.

14,Jay Samit,"YouTube began as a failed video-dating site. Twitter was a failed music service. In each case, the founders continued to try new concepts when their big ideas failed.

23,Christie Brinkley,"We decided to try in vitro, because both Peter and I felt we couldn't handle another failure. When I miscarried after that, we had to come to terms with the possibility that this wasn't meant to be.","[try, handle, meant to be]",failure
