2,John Boyle O'Reilly,"The success of the suffrage movement would injure women spiritually and intellectually, for they would be assuming a burden though they knew themselves unable to bear it.

11,Anna Wintour,"I want 'Vogue' to be pacy, sharp, and sexy - I'm not interested in the super-rich or infinitely leisured.

17,J. G. Ballard,"My room is dominated by the huge painting, which is a copy of 'The Violation' by the Belgian surrealist Paul Delvaux.
