0,Serena Williams,I definitely have found a balance. I've had so many offers in the past to do different movies or different things and I always choose tournaments over it.,"[past, balance, choose]",movies
1,Matt Damon,"If your movies don't perform, they just stop calling you.","[you, stop, calling]",movies
2,Annette Bening,"The tension I feel is the moment they say, 'Action!' Movies are like lightning in a bottle, and you always want to find when you possibly can catch a surprising moment.","[moment, action, find]",movies
3,James Franco,"When we were doing 'Freaks and Geeks', I didn't quite understand how movies and TV worked, and I would improvise even if the camera wasn't on me. I thought I was helping the other actors by keeping them on their toes, but nobody appreciated it when I would trip them up. So I was improvising a little bit back then, but not in a productive way.","[thought, me, camera]",movies
4,Ralph Fiennes,Going to the movies was a big event in my youth. My father would be the initiator - he'd have me put on a jacket to see a film.,"[father, youth, me]",movies
5,Christopher Nolan,I think there's a vague sense out there that movies are becoming more and more unreal. I know I've felt it.,"[know, think, more]",movies
6,Scott Baio,"I can work every day of the year. TV is easy. My call's at 8:30 a.m. I'd like to break out of the comedy thing and take a shot at something serious like theater. The off-season allows me to do movies, but I'm not tired of TV yet. There's nothing like it. I've got the best of both worlds.","[best, work, day]",movies
7,Peter Berg,"I'm pretty upfront about my love and admiration for the military. One of the perks of making movies is that you get to sort of follow your own passions, and I believe quite passionately that we don't pay enough attention and respect to our veterans. Not just our wounded veterans, but all veterans.","[love, respect, believe]",movies
8,Alejandro Amenabar,My movies are not movies of answers but of questions.,"[questions, answers]",movies

10,Joseph Gordon-Levitt,I don't blame folks for not wanting to put me in their movies or whatever. I understand if their audiences had an association with me.,"[blame, me, understand]",movies
11,Gabrielle Union,Reality TV looks more like America than movies do.,"[america, reality, reality tv]",movies
12,Jeff Daniels,"Meryl Streep's brilliant, just brilliant. I've been fortunate to do two movies with Meryl. And for an actor to go moment to moment like she does, there's no one better. And she dances between moments. Each take is different because she's riding instincts, she's riding impulses. And she trusts that.","[moment, moments, she]",movies
13,Debra Winger,I happen to be interested in watching a face age. I like faces of women aging so it makes me personally quite sad. That's a beautiful gift from God. If people don't want to see that anymore then I won't be in anymore movies.,"[god, women, age]",movies

15,Curtis Armstrong,"As an actor I'm part of a long line of character people you can take back to the silent movies. There's always the little guy who's the sidekick to the tall, good-looking guy who gets the girl.","[character, girl, people]",movies
16,Danny Boyle,"Actors are steeped in a world of agents and where the next job is coming from and what are their expenses and what is the hotel like. You want to take them out of that world and dump them into another world, so that when you meet them on the screen they don't seem like the guy who was in two others movies that year.","[job, world, year]",movies
17,Abel Ferrara,"My existence is about making movies, so I've just got to rock and roll with the punches. You want to make movies on telephones, I'm there.","[rock and roll, want, you]",movies
18,Angela Cartwright,"People think it must be wonderful being in movies or on television, but it can be very tough on a child. I had two friends in elementary school. That was it. There was a clique of girls that were brutal to me. They pulled some very mean stuff. My two friends got me through it. Without them, I would have been all alone.","[alone, school, friends]",movies

20,Robert Rodriguez,"I always wanted to be a stay-at-home dad making art, making movies.","[art, dad, always]",movies
21,Bret Michaels,"I want to tell the story. Mostly, when you see rock movies, it has to be this over-the-top thing. I want to give people a Bret Michaels movie where they see that my life is a comedy of errors. I also want to show my fans how to get through the kind of troubles that would leave most people flat on the floor.","[life, people, my life]",movies
22,Jack Black,"Back in the '70s, like one of my favorite movies ever was 'The Bad News Bears', and that was a kids' movie, but I don't think of it that way. I think of it as just a great movie because Walter Matthau was so funny and so harsh with those kids.","[funny, great, think]",movies
23,John Candy,I don't watch my movies. I just get too critical of myself.,"[myself, watch, get]",movies
24,David Sedaris,But most good movies have a gun in them.,"[good, gun, most]",movies
25,Joseph Gordon-Levitt,"I mean, movies in general tend to sort of portray time, space and identity as these very solid things. Time moves forward. Space is what it is. You are you, and you're always you.","[time, identity, space]",movies
