0,William A. Dembski,"Precisely because intelligent design does not turn the study of biological origins into a Bible-science controversy, intelligent design is a position around which Christians of all stripes can unite.","[intelligent, study]",design
1,William A. Dembski,There is an immediate payoff to intelligent design: it destroys the atheistic legacy of Darwinian evolution. Intelligent design makes it impossible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist.,"[legacy, intelligent]",design
2,William A. Dembski,"Give us detailed, testable, mechanistic accounts for the origin of life, the origin of the genetic code, the origin of ubiquitous bio macromolecules and assemblages like the ribosome, and the origin of molecular machines like the bacterial flagellum, and intelligent design will die a quick and painless death.","[life, death, die]",design
3,Dante Ferretti,"I studied fine arts and architecture, but I decided to move into movie design because I grew up in a small town in the Marche region and spent a lot of time after school in the movie theater.","[time, architecture, school]",design
4,John Carmack,"Developing games for the PC and consoles is all about everything and the kitchen sink. In many ways, you don't have design decisions to make. You do it all. So I enjoy going back to making decisions about what's important as I'm working on a game.","[decisions, game, enjoy]",design

6,Donatella Versace,"When I meet celebrities, I have to know what they are like and only then can I design. The clothes have to fit their personality.","[personality, know, clothes]",design
7,Christian Louboutin,"I never wanted to design clothes. I never wanted to work for the fashion industry. Shoes sort of belong to the fashion industry, which is why I'm part of the fashion industry. But that's never been my thought. My thought since I was a child was really to design those shoes for girls on stage.","[work, shoes, thought]",design
8,Jonathan Ive,"The emphasis and value on ideas and original thinking is an innate part of British culture, and in many ways, that describes the traditions of design.","[culture, thinking, value]",design
9,Alber Elbaz,"Many, many times I find that whatever is looking good on the screen doesn't always look or feel good on the body. So who do we design for - do we design for the screen, or do we design for women?","[women, good, looking]",design
10,Anurag Kashyap,"Independent graphic novelists have already achieved good work in terms of design, but all these great minds are writing in English. There is a need for people to write in Hindi.","[work, good, great]",design
11,Vivienne Westwood,"I have too much product, and I'm trying to rein it in and sell more of my main collection.

19,Zeresenay Alemseged,"I learned that the first technology appeared in the form of stone tools, 2.6 million years ago. First entertainment comes evidence from flutes that are 35,000 years old. And evidence for first design comes 75,000 years old - beads. And you can do the same with your genes and track them back in time.","[time, technology, stone]",design
20,Norman Foster,"When the Great Fire of London destroyed most of the medieval city in 1666, Christopher Wren was invited to design a new one. Within days, he had drawn up an elegant grid of broad boulevards leading to majestic squares, but it came to nothing - the existing landowners wanted things as they had been.","[great, fire, london]",design

25,Eva Zeisel,"I don't like to design single objects. I like my pieces to have a relationship to each other. They can be mother and child, like the Schmoo salt and pepper shakers, or brother and sister like the Birdie salt and peppers, or cousins, like most of my dinnerware sets.","[relationship, mother, sister]",design
