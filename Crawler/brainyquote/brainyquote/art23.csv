0,Andrea Bocelli,"I have trouble with modern art. But in general, all art forms fascinate me - art is the way human beings express what we can't say in words.","[words, me, way]",art
1,Emily Rios,"Anything you can do to express yourself is a form of art. That's why I love my craft so much. I always wanted to play other artists. If I can't play an instrument, then I want to play a character that can. There is an artist behind everything, and I think that's beautiful.","[love, beautiful, character]",art
2,Austin Nichols,"I believe in the healing power of the arts, and whenever anyone can bring art into anyone's life, it's a special thing.","[life, power, believe]",art
3,Renzo Piano,"Enjoying art is a personal matter. It's made up by contemplation, silence, abstraction.","[silence, matter, personal]",art
4,Renzo Piano,"As an architect, you have to provide a shelter to enjoy art. And you have to love art. It's like when you make a concert hall. You must love music. This is the reason why you make the space, to enjoy music - making a space for art is the same thing.","[love, music, space]",art
5,Joel Osteen,"Yes, the Bible should be taught in our schools because it is necessary to understand the Bible if we are to truly understand our own culture and how it came to be. The Bible has influenced every part of western culture from our art, music, and history, to our sense of fairness, charity, and business.","[music, business, history]",art
6,Lou Reed,"I was a product of Andy Warhol's Factory. All I did was sit there and observe these incredibly talented and creative people who were continually making art, and it was impossible not to be affected by that.","[people, creative, impossible]",art
7,Ben Harper,"When it comes to partnership, some humans can make their lives alone - it's possible. But creatively, it's more like painting: you can't just use the same colours in every painting. It's just not an option. You can't take the same photograph every time and live with art forms with no differences.","[time, alone, differences]",art
8,Dan Brown,"Washington, D.C., has everything that Rome, Paris and London have in the way of great architecture - great power bases. Washington has obelisks and pyramids and underground tunnels and great art and a whole shadow world that we really don't see.","[power, great, architecture]",art
9,James Franco,I love to bring humour into my work. Because comedy is not a huge part of the art world. And big-business film takes itself very seriously.,"[love, work, world]",art
10,Wassily Kandinsky,"With few exceptions, music has been for some centuries the art which has devoted itself not to the reproduction of natural phenomena, but rather to the expression of the artist's soul, in musical sound.","[music, soul, artist]",art
11,Jason Mraz,"I recently read that it's the left brain that does all that calculating, and the right brain that does the poetry. Somehow I've veered way towards the left. I've been doing it for years. Maybe I do art to balance it out.","[poetry, balance, brain]",art
12,Marilyn Manson,"My art is not limited to the songs I create but also to the reaction it creates. I like to sit back and look at the whole thing as if it's a tornado that I'm controlling. It's creating chaos. When you create chaos, ideas are turned upside down, and everybody looks at things in a different way.","[ideas, chaos, upside down]",art
13,Tom Stoppard,I was an awful critic. I operated on the assumption that there was an absolute scale of values against which art could be measured. I didn't trust my own subjective responses.,"[trust, values, measured]",art
14,Tony Hawk,"I feel like skateboarding is as much of a sport as a lifestyle, and an art form, so there's so much that that transcends in terms of music, fashion, and entertainment.","[music, fashion, feel]",art
15,Jeffrey Brown,"I was always most interested in drawing - most of my childhood drawings are black-and-white line work. And when I kind of abandoned comics, through college and art school, I was doing a lot of painting. But once I started doing comics again, everything else just fell by the wayside.","[work, college, school]",art
16,Jordan Ladd,"All I know is movies; I went to school, but movies are my reference point for everything. I figured I'd have to P.A. or intern in the art department. Because the filmmaking process is so many people creating to make one piece of magic, so I've always wanted to be involved. With the acting, I doubted it.","[school, people, magic]",art
17,John James Audubon,"Poor France, thy fine climate, rich vineyards, and the wishes of the learned avail nothing; thou art a destitute beggar, and not the powerful friend thou wert represented to me.","[me, rich, nothing]",art
18,John Updike,American art in general... takes to surreal exaggerations and metaphors; but its Puritan work ethic has little use for the playful self-indulgence behind Parisian Surrealism.,"[work, american, work ethic]",art
19,Jessye Norman,"I am deeply spiritual; I revel in those things that make for good - the things that we can do to shed a little light, to help place an oft-dissonant universe back in tune with itself... Long live art, long live friendship, long live the joy of life!","[life, friendship, light]",art
20,"Martin Luther King, Jr.","Every man lives in two realms: the internal and the external. The internal is that realm of spiritual ends expressed in art, literature, morals, and religion. The external is that complex of devices, techniques, mechanisms, and instrumentalities by means of which we live.","[religion, spiritual, man]",art
21,Maya Angelou,"I'm happy to be a writer - of prose, poetry, every kind of writing. Every person in the world who isn't a recluse, hermit or mute uses words. I know of no other art form that we always use.","[happy, poetry, writing]",art
22,Oscar Wilde,"Art is individualism, and individualism is a disturbing and disintegrating force.","[individualism, force]",art
23,Oscar Wilde,"All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril. Those who read the symbol do so at their peril. It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors. Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new, complex and vital.","[life, work, diversity]",art
24,Oscar Wilde,"If a work of art is rich and vital and complete, those who have artistic instincts will see its beauty, and those to whom ethics appeal more strongly than aesthetics will see its moral lesson. It will fill the cowardly with terror, and the unclean will see in it their own shame.","[work, beauty, ethics]",art
25,Oscar Wilde,"Bad people are, from the point of view of art, fascinating studies. They represent colour, variety and strangeness. Good people exasperate one's reason; bad people stir one's imagination.","[good, imagination, people]",art
