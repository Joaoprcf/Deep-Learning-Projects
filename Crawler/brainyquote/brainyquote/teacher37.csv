0,Sela Ward,I had an art teacher who's the reason I got there in high school who encouraged me to go to Alabama. That's where she had gone and kept raving over their art department.,"[art, school, me]",teacher
1,Kurt Masur,"The message of music was also the first thing what I learned from my first teacher.

2,Jeremy Irvine,"I had a great drama teacher, and he sort of made out drama school as this incredibly difficult thing to get into: 6,000 people apply every year, and some of the schools only have 12 places. It's a phenomenally difficult thing to get into. And that excited me - I wanted that challenge.","[great, school, challenge]",teacher
3,Louis Sachar,"I remember my fourth grade teacher reading 'Charlotte's Web' and 'Stuart Little' to us - both, of course, by E. B. White. His stories were genuinely funny, thought provoking and full of irony and charm. He didn't condescend to his readers, which was why I liked his books, and why I wasn't a big reader of other children's' books.","[funny, children, reading]",teacher
4,David Suchet,"When I was 16, I played Macbeth at school and my English teacher said, 'I think you may have acting talent. Try to get into the National Youth Theatre of Great Britain and see where you get.' I wouldn't have thought of that at all. I wanted to be a surgeon, but I wasn't a clever man.","[great, school, man]",teacher
5,Dev Hynes,"I was 13 years old at music school talking to my teacher. I can't quite remember what it was I was trying to describe, but I do remember my music teacher saying to me, 'Do you have synesthesia?' In hindsight, it seems a little presumptuous of her to think a little boy in Essex would know what synesthesia was.","[music, school, me]",teacher
6,Barry Hannah,"I wouldn't be happy had I only been a teacher, if all I had done was help young people, frankly. I don't get nearly the joy teaching as I do out of creation.","[joy, happy, help]",teacher
7,William Sanderson,"The best came from my martial arts teacher, who also taught Elvis. He said, 'Your ego will get you killed.'","[best, ego, said]",teacher
8,Lily Allen,When a music teacher that I had at school was taken ill and we had a variety show and I had to fill in - that's when I realized I had a voice.,"[music, school, voice]",teacher
9,Syd Barrett,If I'd stayed at college I would have become a teacher.,"[college, become, would]",teacher
10,Patch Adams,"The medium of response in America is fame; that's how a person that bounces a ball can make millions of dollars, and a school teacher with no fame makes $35,000.","[school, america, fame]",teacher
11,John Strachan,To this end the greatest asset of a school is the personality of the teacher.,"[end, greatest, school]",teacher
12,Edwin Meese,"The Black Panthers was what we would call today a criminal gang that was formed by Huey Newton. Now, interestingly enough, I knew Huey Newton before he formed the Black Panthers. He was a student of mine when I was a teacher, instructor at Oakland City College back in the very early 1960s.","[today, college, black]",teacher
13,Maximillian Degenerez,"Delayed gratification is a sweet lesson whose teacher knows the best is not right now, it is yet to be.","[best, sweet, lesson]",teacher
14,Devon Sawa,"I spent most of my high school years on movie sets and I'd have like one teacher, which was really bad.","[school, bad, high school]",teacher
15,Edward P. Jones,"My mother worked in the white world, but I lived almost exclusively in a black world. I don't think I had ever seen a white teacher until I got to high school.","[mother, school, black]",teacher
16,John Corey Whaley,I've been an assistant to a folklorist and a teacher. There may or may not have been some sandwich-making at a certain sub chain in my past as well.,"[past, may, assistant]",teacher
17,Todrick Hall,"I was introduced to theater by a teacher that found me when I was in elementary school. She tested me for the Gifted and Talented program, started taking me to see the 'Nutcracker Ballet.' I got involved.","[school, me, she]",teacher
18,Willard Wigan,My teacher said my brain was the size of a pea. He made my life miserable by singling me out in the classroom as a failure.,"[life, failure, brain]",teacher
19,Marie Lu,"I receive emails from readers that both break my heart and give me a profound sense of connection. Several months ago, I received an email from a teacher who told me that 'Legend' was the first book one of her troubled young students had ever read to the end. He cried when he finished it. Stories like that stay with you forever.","[end, heart, book]",teacher
20,Chris Raschka,Openness is something any teacher strives to instill in his or her students.,"[students, something, her]",teacher
21,Chris Raschka,"To learn to ride a bicycle, as with the other great noble human inventions, is a hugely complex activity. Generally, it requires three things: the learner, the teacher and the bicycle, all in the same place at the same time, most often outside someplace.","[time, great, learn]",teacher
22,Rob Delaney,"I'm crazy about Shakespeare, who was a notorious word inventor. And my wife is an English teacher, and she's hilarious.","[wife, crazy, she]",teacher
23,Randa Abdel-Fattah,"One of the first serious attempts I made to write a novel was when I was in Grade 6 and I had read 'Matilda.' I wrote my own version and my teacher had it bound and permitted me to read it to the class - cementing my love of reading, writing and Roald Dahl!","[love, writing, reading]",teacher
24,David Soul,"My father was my main influence. He was a preacher, but he was also a history and political science teacher, and since he was my hero, I wanted to follow in his footsteps and become a teacher.","[history, father, science]",teacher
25,James Wolk,"My mom is an art teacher and my dad owns a women's shoe store, so they're not actors by any means. Well, I guess to sell women's shoes, you have to be an actor.","[art, women, mom]",teacher
