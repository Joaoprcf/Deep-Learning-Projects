0,Lynn Abbey,"When I'm not writing or tweaking my computer, I do embroidery. When I'm not plunging into the past, tweaking, or embroidering, I'm reading books about history, computers, or embroidery.","[history, past, writing]",computers
1,Berkeley Breathed,It was a huge challenge to learn digital painting well enough so that computers don't pop into mind when one sees one.,"[mind, challenge, learn]",computers
2,Seth Lloyd,Something else has happened with computers.,"[something, else, happened]",computers
3,Seth Lloyd,"What's happened with society is that we have created these devices, computers, which already can register and process huge amounts of information, which is a significant fraction of the amount of information that human beings themselves, as a species, can process.","[society, information]",computers
4,Chris Riddell,"As the Kindle's dread grip on digital publishing is challenged by tablet computers and Android smartphones, with their bright screens and high resolution, the need for illustration is growing.","[resolution, digital, growing]",computers
5,Jason Schwartzman,"There's all these ways to instantly communicate - cars, computers, telephone and transportation - and even with all that, it's so hard to find people and have an honest communication with them.","[communication, people, find]",computers
6,Kirsty Gallacher,The idea that so many kids eat rubbish and sit on computers all day long appals me and getting them into sport is a major way of getting them off computers and leading healthier lives.,"[day, me, way]",computers
7,Sugata Mitra,I'm encouraging kids to use computers at their own pace to build aspirations.,"[build, kids, own]",computers
8,Irwin Winkler,I just think there's a general interest in the world of computers.,"[world, think, interest]",computers
9,Jared Leto,I take computers practically apart and put them back together. I have a supercomputer I built over the years out of different computers.,"[together, back, different]",computers
10,John Roberts,"I don't type on the computer or edit. Law students who went to law school really just a couple years after I did were brought up all on the computers and that's how they do it, but I was still part of the older school.","[school, law, students]",computers
11,Jon Postel,One of the things that is not so good is that a decision was made long ago about the size of an IP address - 32 bits. At the time it was a number much larger than anyone could imagine ever having that many computers but it turned out to be to small.,"[time, good, small]",computers
12,Gary Wolf,"As a science fiction fan, I had always assumed that when computers supplemented our intelligence, it would be because we outsourced some of our memory to them. We would ask questions, and our machines would give oracular - or supremely practical - replies.","[science, intelligence]",computers
13,Catherine Bell,"We're just into toys, whether it's motorcycles or race cars or computers. I've got the Palm Pilot right here with me, I've got the world's smallest phone. Maybe it's just because I'm still a big little kid and I just love toys, you know?","[love, car, world]",computers
14,Vikram Patel,"Those who believe that health is a commodity, on par with cars or computers, fail to grasp the basic economic lesson that health is very vulnerable to exposure to the markets, not least due to the profound asymmetries in power between the providers and consumers.","[health, power, believe]",computers
15,Nick Jonas,"I'm actually pretty good with computers. I use computers when I'm working on making and producing music, so I do know a thing or two!","[music, good, know]",computers
16,Nicholas Negroponte,"We've been working now with computers and education for 30 years, computers in developing countries for 20 years, and trying to make low-cost machines for 10 years. This is not a sudden turn down the road.","[education, road, trying]",computers
17,Gerhard Richter,"We've lost these qualities, these abilities to do something by hand. Some illustrators have it still, but it's just not art. We have photography. We have cameras and computers that do it better and faster.","[art, photography, lost]",computers
18,Aaron Koblin,"I've always been interested in technology, but specifically how we can use machines to engage the imagination. I started using computers when I was young and was fascinated by creating rules and instructions that allow a computer to engage in a dialogue with humans. The stories found in the data all around us can do just that.","[technology, imagination]",computers
19,Aaron Koblin,"As a kid, I was always into art at the same time as computers, and eventually I realised I was making more interesting stuff with my keyboard than with my hands. I really enjoyed modifying computer games more than playing them, so that got me into programming.","[time, art, hands]",computers
20,Rhianna Pratchett,"Dad was very into electronics, robotics and computers, so I was interested in what he was doing.","[dad, doing, robotics]",computers
21,Herbert A. Simon,"When computers came along, I felt for the first time that I had the proper tools for the kind of theoretical work I wanted to do. So I moved over to that, and that got me into psychology.","[work, time, me]",computers
22,James Fallows,"Over the eons I've been a fan of, and sucker for, each latest automated system to 'simplify' and 'bring order to' my life. Very early on this led me to the beautiful-and-doomed Lotus Agenda for my DOS computers, and Actioneer for the early Palm.","[life, me, my life]",computers
23,Brian Acton,"Yes, I was a big math and computer geek, that's true. I was driven by the scholastic side of things. For me, it was all about what I could do with math and computers.","[me, true, math]",computers
24,Bidzina Ivanishvili,I was writing my Ph.D. in the late 1980s and was keeping an eye on what was happening in the world. It became obvious to me that Russia couldn't live without computers. I think I worked this out a year before anyone else. I started looking for people who could help import them.,"[writing, help, world]",computers
25,Rodney Brooks,"Computers sort of came around through games and toys. And you know, the first computer most people had in the house may have been a computer to play 'Pong,' a little microprocessor embedded, and then other games that came after that.","[people, know, you]",computers
