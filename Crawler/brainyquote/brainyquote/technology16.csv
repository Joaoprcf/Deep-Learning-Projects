1,Jose Padilha,"Pretty soon we'll have robots in our society, you're going to have a lot of automated processes that used to be done by people - this is happening. Society and technology is changing so fast, and the impact of the change on society and technology is global, not local.","[change, society, people]",technology
2,Simon Mainwaring,"Like all technology, social media is neutral but is best put to work in the service of building a better world.","[best, work, social media]",technology
3,Laura Marling,"I know there are lots of positives in the evolution of technology, but I also think it will be responsible for the end of a unique character, of a specific kind of geographical culture. The world is getting so small, and mass production is getting so big. Everything is in danger of becoming the same.","[culture, character, end]",technology
4,Doris Kearns Goodwin,"The only protection as a historian is to institute a process of research and writing that minimizes the possibility of error. And that I have tried to do, aided by modern technology, which enables me, having long since moved beyond longhand, to use a computer for both organizing and taking notes.","[writing, research, me]",technology
5,James Dyson,Design and technology should be the subject where mathematical brainboxes and science whizzkids turn their bright ideas into useful products.,"[science, design, ideas]",technology
6,Mickey Hart,"I hated science in high school. Technology? Engineering? Math? Why would I ever need this? Little did I realize that music was also about science, technology, engineering and mathematics, all rolled into one.","[music, science, mathematics]",technology
7,Vinod Khosla,"Religion asks you to believe things without questioning, and technology and science always encourage you to ask hard questions and why it is important in science and technology. So I was always interested in science and technology.","[science, religion, believe]",technology
8,Marc Andreessen,"An awful lot of successful technology companies ended up being in a slightly different market than they started out in. Microsoft started with programming tools, but came out with an operating system. Oracle started doing contracts for the CIA. AOL started out as an online video gaming network.","[successful, doing, tools]",technology
9,Ben Horowitz,"With communication technology in general, there's a kind of certain critical mass of people. Once you get to 15% of the world's entire population using one communication technology, that's a big deal. It's beyond the theoretical at this point. The people who think it's a fad have probably not been paying that much attention.","[communication, world, people]",technology
10,Aaron Levie,The business models in enterprise have changed pretty dramatically. A huge problem with enterprise software traditionally has been usually you sell to the customer and then they adopt the technology. The great thing about 'freemium' and the new way enterprise software is being sold is you get to try it first and then buy it.,"[business, great, problem]",technology
11,Neil Postman,"I am not a Luddite. I am suspicious of technology. I am perfectly aware of its benefits, but I also try to pay attention to some of the negative effects.","[i am, negative, attention]",technology
12,Siddhartha Mukherjee,Postwar U.S. was the world's leader in science and technology. The investment in science research was staggering.,"[science, leader, research]",technology
13,Ryan Trecartin,"I think technology is us, not something we invented. I think we are more psychic now because we have cell phones and you can look and see who's calling you. When people start seeing technology as us, as humanity, our whole idea of what existence is, is going to shift.","[humanity, people, start]",technology
14,John Katzman,"The Internet rewards scale; by trading higher up-front costs for lower marginal cost, market leaders can invest in better technology and service. As a result, there is nothing online that is both great in quality and small in scale. Amazon wasn't originally a better bookstore than the small shops we mourn, but it is now.","[great, service, quality]",technology
15,Nathan Myhrvold,"If you had a really good - battery, it wouldn't matter that the sun goes down at night and the wind stops blowing sometimes. But at the moment, battery technology is nowhere near good enough to use at utility scale.","[good, sun, night]",technology
16,Cameron Sinclair,"When you as a designer design something that burdens a community with maintenance and old world technology, basically failed developed world technology, then you will crush that community way beyond bad design; you'll destroy the economics of that community, and often the community socially is broken.","[community, design, economics]",technology
17,Fred Wilson,"New York's niche is content, and content is becoming more valuable. Just think about what is more valuable: MTV or the cable system that you use to get MTV? Howard Stern or the radio station you use to listen to him? Ultimately, technology becomes a commodity, and content - real, true branded content - becomes more valuable.","[listen, content, true]",technology
18,Ashton Kutcher,"I really think that technology has the greatest potential to accelerate happiness of most things in the world. The companies that will ultimately do well are the companies that chase happiness. If you find a way to help people find love, or health or friendship, the dollar will chase that.","[love, friendship, happiness]",technology
19,Ashton Kutcher,"The film industry brings people together, and so does technology. I see them as similar platforms.","[together, people, see]",technology
20,Queen Rania of Jordan,"In education, technology can be a life-changer, a game changer, for kids who are both in school and out of school. Technology can bring textbooks to life. The Internet can connect students to their peers in other parts of the world. It can bridge the quality gaps.","[life, education, school]",technology
21,Ginni Rometty,"What has always made IBM a fascinating and compelling place for me is the passion of the company, and its people, to apply technology and scientific thinking to major societal issues.","[passion, thinking, people]",technology
22,Buzz Aldrin,"There's no doubt who was a leader in space after the Apollo Program. Nobody came close to us. And our education system, in science, technology, engineering and math, was at the top of the world. It's no longer there. We're descending rather rapidly.","[education, science, leader]",technology
23,George Lucas,"All art is dependent on technology because it's a human endeavour, so even when you're using charcoal on a wall or designed the proscenium arch, that's technology.","[art, you, human]",technology
24,George Lucas,Digital technology allows us a much larger scope to tell stories that were pretty much the grounds of the literary media.,"[media, digital, pretty]",technology
25,Yoko Ono,"The computer is my favourite invention. I feel lucky to be part of the global village. I don't mean to brag, but I'm so fast with technology. People think it all seems too much, but we'll get used to it. I'm sure it all seemed too much when we were learning to walk.","[learning, people, walk]",technology
