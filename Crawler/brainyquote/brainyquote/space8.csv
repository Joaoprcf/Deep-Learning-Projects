0,Buzz Aldrin,"I've led a life of such structured discipline and always had a goal in mind of knowing what I was doing, from West Point to the Air Force combat, MIT, looking for new things to study and get involved in. And then I got into the space program, and how disciplined can you get?","[life, goal, mind]",space
1,Brian Blessed,"When I was a child, I wanted to... go into space! To go to Mars. I wanted to explore and explore and explore. I wanted to go to the Lost World in South America - I was heartbroken to discover there were no dinosaurs; I still don't accept it.","[america, world, child]",space
2,Maya Angelou,"What is a fear of living? It's being preeminently afraid of dying. It is not doing what you came here to do, out of timidity and spinelessness. The antidote is to take full responsibility for yourself - for the time you take up and the space you occupy. If you don't know what you're here to do, then just do some good.","[time, fear, good]",space
3,J. Michael Straczynski,"A lot of the futuristic space stuff seemed to me to be a very cool form of science-fiction, so that was my first real baptism in the genre.","[cool, me, real]",space
4,J. Michael Straczynski,"When you're writing a story in bits and pieces, month in and month out, there really isn't time or space for reflection, no room to learn what those scripts had to teach you.","[time, reflection, writing]",space
5,David Lee Roth,"It doesn't matter the kind of music, it doesn't matter whether it's a cowboy hat or a yarmulke. I don't care if it's outer space or pop, the spirit is the same.","[music, care, hat]",space
6,Wole Soyinka,"Each time I think I've created time for myself, along comes a throwback to disrupt my private space.","[time, myself, think]",space
7,Neil deGrasse Tyson,"If you're going to lead a space frontier, it has to be government; it'll never be private enterprise. Because the space frontier is dangerous, and it's expensive, and it has unquantified risks. And under those conditions, you cannot establish a capital-market evaluation of that enterprise. You can't get investors.","[government, risks, you]",space
8,P. J. O'Rourke,"A 'farm' today means 100,000 chickens in a space the size of a Motel 6 shower stall.","[today, shower, size]",space
9,Martin Rees,"Ironically, it is only when disaster strikes that the shuttle makes the headlines. Its routine flights attracted less media interest than unmanned probes to the planets or the images from the Hubble Telescope. The fate of Columbia (like that of Challenger in 1986) reminded us that space is still a hazardous environment.","[media, environment, fate]",space
10,Martin Rees,"The bedrock nature of space and time and the unification of cosmos and quantum are surely among science's great 'open frontiers.' These are parts of the intellectual map where we're still groping for the truth - where, in the fashion of ancient cartographers, we must still inscribe 'here be dragons.'","[time, nature, science]",space
11,Martin Rees,"Space and time may have a structure as intricate as the fauna of a rich ecosystem, but on a scale far larger than the horizon of our observations.","[time, rich, horizon]",space
12,Nancy Gibbs,"Most of us were probably less than immaculately honest as teenagers; it's practically encoded into adolescence that you savor your secrets, dress in disguise, carve out some space for experiments and accidents and all the combustible lab work of becoming who you are.","[work, dress, secrets]",space
13,Buzz Aldrin,"If we can conquer space, we can conquer childhood hunger.","[childhood, conquer, hunger]",space
14,Kevin A. Ford,"Space station is, it really is one of the more, if not the most, impressive technological achievement of the modern day, not only in what we've accomplished engineering-wise but what we've accomplished on this international scale, because anybody will tell you that half the challenge is making it all work.","[work, achievement, day]",space
15,Confucius,"The superior man does not, even for the space of a single meal, act contrary to virtue. In moments of haste, he cleaves to it. In seasons of danger, he cleaves to it.","[man, moments, seasons]",space
16,Ramana Maharshi,"Time and space always change, but there is something which is eternal and changeless. For example, the world and time, past or future, nothing exists for us in sleep. But we exist. Let us try to find out that which is changeless and which always exists.","[change, time, future]",space
17,John L. Phillips,"We're going to be focusing our science on things that will take us farther and longer into space. For many of those experiments, the crew members are human guinea pigs, which is fine; that's part of my job. I don't mind being a human guinea pig.","[science, mind, job]",space
18,Muhammad Iqbal,Thus passing through the infinite varieties of space we reach the Divine space which is absolutely free from all dimensions and constitutes the meeting point of all infinities.,"[meeting, free, reach]",space
19,Jackson Pollock,"The modern artist is working with space and time, and expressing his feelings rather than illustrating.","[time, art, artist]",space
20,Mark Consuelos,"I'm claustrophobic. I can't go into haunted houses. They have these tight, dark, enclosed space. I freak out. That's my phobia. It gets me out of stuff. Someone asks me to do something and I tell them I can't because I'm claustrophobic.","[dark, me, someone]",space
21,Werner Herzog,"Perhaps I seek certain utopian things, space for human honour and respect, landscapes not yet offended, planets that do not exist yet, dreamed landscapes.","[respect, honour, offended]",space
22,Adlai E. Stevenson,"We travel together, passengers on a little spaceship, dependent on its vulnerable reserves of air and soil, all committed, for our safety, to its security and peace. Preserved from annihilation only by the care, the work and the love we give our fragile craft.","[love, work, travel]",space
23,Alan Shepard,It's a very sobering feeling to be up in space and realize that one's safety factor was determined by the lowest bidder on a government contract.,"[safety, government, feeling]",space
24,Arthur C. Clarke,"Perhaps, as some wit remarked, the best proof that there is Intelligent Life in Outer Space is the fact it hasn't come here. Well, it can't hide forever - one day we will overhear it.","[life, best, day]",space
