1,Marcia Gay Harden,I had a science teacher in middle school who inspired me... simply because she acknowledged me and made me feel that what I had to offer was worthy.,"[teacher, school, me]",science
2,Orlando Bloom,I went to Antarctica on a science research boat just to sort of clear my head.,"[research, boat, head]",science
3,Henry Petroski,"Because they are so humbled by their creations, engineers are naturally conservative in their expectations of technology. They know that the perfect system is the stuff of science fiction, not of engineering fact, and so everything must be treated with respect.","[technology, respect]",science
4,Ted Cruz,"Many of the alarmists on global warming, they've got a problem because the science doesn't back them up.","[global warming, problem]",science
5,Nancy Roman,One of the reasons I like working with schools is to try to convince women that they can be scientists and that science can be fun.,"[women, fun, try]",science
6,Alastair Reynolds,"I'm always a little bit cautious around invented terminology because so much science fiction is off-putting to the uninitiated. You open up the first page, and it's full of all these made-up words.","[words, page, fiction]",science

15,Adam Christopher,"My own writing has perhaps more of an American flavor than a British one, but that's because the stories I've so far written have needed it.

I have derived them from the teachings of my Master, the Buddha.","[equality, religion]",science

22,Aldous Huxley,Science has explained nothing; the more we know the more fantastic the world becomes and the profounder the surrounding darkness.,"[darkness, world, know]",science
23,Daniel Radcliffe,"I like science and I love gym. Oh, and I like art, but I'm really bad at it. I'm just a terrible drawer. I can't draw a circle. Even with a ruler, I can't draw a straight line.","[love, art, circle]",science
24,Dave Ramsey,The thing I have discovered about working with personal finance is that the good news is that it is not rocket science. Personal finance is about 80 percent behavior. It is only about 20 percent head knowledge.,"[knowledge, good, finance]",science
