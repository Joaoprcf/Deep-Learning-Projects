1,Jerry Saltz,"All of Koons's best art - the encased vacuum cleaners, the stainless-steel Rabbit (the late-twentieth century's signature work of Simulationist sculpture), the amazing gleaming Balloon Dog, and the cast-iron re-creation of a Civil War mortar exhibited last month at the Armory - has simultaneously flaunted extreme realism, idealism, and fantasy.","[best, work, art]",amazing
2,Dylan O'Brien,"My heroes are guys like Tom Hanks, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Matt Damon. These are amazing actors with amazing careers that every actor should aspire to. I'm not saying I'm going to get anywhere close. It's not going to be an easy feat. I'm just in awe of their careers.","[easy, actor, heroes]",amazing
3,John Burdett,"It is quite amazing how hard the subconscious works when it is made to understand that this life is not a rehearsal, there is no safety net and no assurance of any final closure. It is also quite appalling to realize how catatonic the imagination can become when we hedge our bets, opt for the safer direction at every fork in the path.","[life, path, imagination]",amazing
4,Mattie Stepanek,Remember to look at your glass half full and not half empty. A lot of my strength comes from God. God has given me a gift - the gift of life - and it's amazing that I live each day.,"[life, strength, god]",amazing
5,Tina Fey,"I'm not that good looking... nobody is that good looking. I have seen a lot of movie stars, and maybe four are amazing looking. The rest have a team of gay guys who make it happen.","[good, stars, team]",amazing
6,Steve Harvey,"I don't want people to see me fall. I mean, I got enough people cheering for me to fall now... The Internet has created some amazing place for evil to exist, you dig?","[evil, internet, people]",amazing
7,Joyce Meyer,"God's grace is amazing! We're saved by grace - God's undeserved favor - and we live by grace, which is also God's power in our lives to do what we could never do in our own strength. And it's all because God is love, and He loves us unconditionally, constantly and completely.","[love, strength, god]",amazing
8,Joyce Meyer,"When you become a Christian, something truly amazing happens: God comes to live inside your heart. You become the home of God.","[home, god, heart]",amazing
9,Salman Khan,"I no longer do a film for the wrong reasons. I have to be convinced ethically and morally. Both the director and I have to be on the same page. There are just five songs in most films these days, and they have to be amazing. There has to be a twist in the screenplay. The editing has to be crisp. Your hard work should show, but effortlessly.","[work, hard work, page]",amazing
10,Larry the Cable Guy,"I think probably one of the coolest things was when I went to play basketball at Rucker Park in Harlem.

There were guys walking by yelling, 'Git 'r done!'","[walking, basketball, people]",amazing

13,Celia Imrie,"Pat Phoenix kept that amazing sassy look. I always wonder, was that because she was thrilled with that look, and thought it looked marvellous, or was it because she was too scared to change it? It's a double thing. Security and insecurity.","[change, security, thought]",amazing
14,Richard Simmons,Count your blessings. You are one of a kind. There's no one in the world like you. You are amazing.,"[blessings, world, you]",amazing
15,Ryan Reynolds,"I played rugby for years, and I had a rugby jacket that I lost when I was 14. Somehow, my brother found it in storage 15 years later, and he gave it back to me for my 30th birthday.

16,Joe Rogan,"What's interesting about science is that we're constantly discovering new things about the universe, about ourselves, about our bodies, about diseases, about the possibilities of the future. It's amazing. Science is one of the coolest things about being a human being - without a doubt.","[future, science, universe]",amazing
17,Matt Groening,"There's always room out there for the hand-drawn image. I personally like the imperfection of hand drawing as opposed to the slick look of computer animation. But you can do good stuff either way. The Pixar movies are amazing in what they do, but there's plenty of independent animators who are doing really amazing things as well.","[good, drawing, imperfection]",amazing
18,Sarah McLachlan,"There's beauty everywhere. There are amazing things happening everywhere, you just have to be able to open your eyes and witness it. Some days, that's harder than others.","[beauty, eyes, you]",amazing
19,Bill Gates,"What's amazing is, if young people understood how doing well in school makes the rest of their life so much interesting, they would be more motivated. It's so far away in time that they can't appreciate what it means for their whole life.","[life, time, school]",amazing
20,Ray Bradbury,"When I was seven or eight years old, I began to read the science-fiction magazines that were brought by guests into my grandparents' boarding house in Waukegan, Illinois.

22,Olivia Newton-John,"'Grease' changed my life in the most amazing way, and I've had such an amazing life. When things go wrong, you've got to believe you will get through them and focus on the positive things in your life.","[life, positive, focus]",amazing
23,Becki Newton,"After leaving school, I travelled around Europe for about six months. In Denmark, I thought that was my chance to get an amazing haircut, so I went to what I thought was a great hairdresser. It turned out to be the car wash of hairdressers, and I walked out sporting yet another pudding bowl, but this time with a stripe bleached down the centre.","[time, great, car]",amazing
24,Adam Hamilton,"We live on a planet that is amazing, beautiful, and full of wonder but not protected from powerful destructive forces of nature.
