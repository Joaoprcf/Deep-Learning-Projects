4,Harold Prince,"You could argue that 'Sweeney Todd' was romantic, if you looked closely at it, but it didn't impart that to its audiences. But it's large, and it's melodramatic, and it's a style I like to work in periodically.","[work, style, you]",romantic

7,Gabrielle Union,"I love romantic comedies. They're for me the easiest thing to do and the most natural to do. There's nothing natural about holding an uzi hanging out of a moving van shooting at people. That's not second nature to me, thank God.","[love, nature, god]",romantic

12,Lake Bell,"What I think is sad about the rom-com genre is that it has adopted this pejorative title. I think the reason why there haven't been as many great ones is because we are fighting against the genre itself.

21,Rachel Zoe,Fall 2013 was inspired by the 1970s equestrian lifestyle. I wanted to incorporate the moody and romantic - intricate baroque detailing and classic menswear elements - with something tougher and edgier in a nod to London's rock n' roll underground.,"[london, fall, rock]",romantic
22,Jacqueline Bisset,"I've done five films directed by women. I did like it. They had qualities, particularly in the romantic tenderness of scenes.
