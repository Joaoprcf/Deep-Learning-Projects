4,Sophia Bush,"So, I'm always around video games but I've always been interested in them from a visual perspective, with the graphic design and that whole thing.

5,Ed Westwick,"I think gardens are fantastic, and I'd love to draw and design and stuff like that. I love just planting flowers during the summer. There's something very humble about it, and natural and beautiful.","[love, flowers, beautiful]",design
6,Jason Reitman,"Can you design a Rorschach test that's going to make everyone feel something every time - and that looks like a Rorschach test?

9,Alvar Aalto,"Once I tried to make a standardization of staircases. Probably that is one of the oldest of the standardizations. Of course, we design new staircase steps every day in connection with all our houses, but a standardized step depends on the height of the buildings and on all kinds of things.","[day, step, connection]",design

13,Christian Louboutin,"People say I am the king of painful shoes. I don't want to create painful shoes, but it is not my job to create something comfortable.

21,Friedrich August von Hayek,The curious task of economics is to demonstrate to men how little they really know about what they imagine they can design.,"[men, finance, economics]",design
22,Zaha Hadid,I am equally proud of all of my architectural projects. It's always rewarding to see an ambitious design become reality.,"[i am, reality, proud]",design
23,Mark Helprin,"The craftless anarchy of the Beat poets on the one hand, and the extreme control of Henry James on the other, suggest that for most human beings, just as both freedom and discipline are necessary in life, serendipity and design must coexist in a work to make it readable.","[life, work, freedom]",design
24,Bill Gates,"If you have 50 different plug types, appliances wouldn't be available and would be very expensive.
