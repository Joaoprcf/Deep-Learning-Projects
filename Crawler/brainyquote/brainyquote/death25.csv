0,Tony Judt,"No one wants to live in a wheelchair unable to talk, only winking once for yes and twice for no. It's perfectly reasonable that there will come a point where the balance of judgment of life over death swings the other way.","[life, balance, live]",death

5,J. Tillman,"My last album as J. Tillman, 'Singing Ax,' that was really a premeditated death rattle of the aesthetic precedent I had set.

7,Gloria Estefan,"The reason I'm not more political is because I have music. And from a young age, I needed it.

10,Tony Campolo,I'm not denying that depression can be spiritually induced. Guilt from having wronged and hurt others can bring it on.

11,Jenny Downham,"If I learnt anything at all about terminal illness in my research, it's that the experience is different for everyone. I do believe that life becomes concentrated when it's boundaried and that death is the biggest boundary of all.","[life, experience, believe]",death

14,J. C. Ryle,"The true Christian is called to be a soldier and must behave as such from the day of his conversion to the day of his death.

15,Harvey Fierstein,"I was exposed to a mix of cultures, lots of different religions and beliefs. I was a spiritual kid and went to Indian powwows and Buddhist temples.

20,Michael Palmer,"You're taught from the day you start medical school that you're a god, that you can have power over life and death.
