0,Ted Cruz,"How do we turn our nation around? President Obama thinks the answer is more and more government. Government is not the answer. You are not doing anyone a favor by creating dependency, destroying individual responsibility.","[responsibility, doing, you]",government
1,Artur Davis,"And in terms of their crown jewel legislative achievement: who knew that when asked, 'will government impose a new federal mandate requiring middle class Americans to buy health insurance whether they can afford it or not?' The answer would be 'Yes we can!'","[health, achievement]",government
2,Jim DeMint,You've got the Democratic Party that now depends on more government spending and actual building the dependence on government in order to increase their political party.,"[political, building, party]",government
3,Reince Priebus,"Obama has demonstrated no desire to make tough choices. Americans demand a more efficient, effective government, but his budget calls for more taxes and more spending. It employs deceptive accounting gimmicks but does nothing to tackle long-term entitlement problems, nothing to save Medicare or fix Social Security.","[choices, security]",government
4,Demetri Martin,"I didn't do improv in college, I never performed, I didn't do theater either. I was in student government, I was a history major.","[history, college, student]",government

6,Ai Weiwei,"Chinese citizens have never had the right to really express their opinions; in the constitution it says you can, but in the real world it is more dangerous. In the west people think it's a right they're born with. Here it's a right given by the government, and one that's not really practised.","[constitution, world, people]",government
7,Ann Richards,"I did not want my tombstone to read, 'She kept a really clean house.' I think I'd like them to remember me by saying, 'She opened government to everyone.'","[me, remember, want]",government
8,Harry Browne,"Government is force, pure and simple. There's no way to sugar-coat that.

9,Evo Morales,The relationship between the government of the United States and social and indigenous movements has always been difficult. Not just in Bolivia but worldwide. We need to have bilateral relations characterized by mutual respect.,"[relationship, respect]",government
10,Mark Levin,"What the Founding Fathers created in the Constitution is the most magnificent government on the face of the Earth, and the reason is this: because it was intended to preserve the American society and the American spirit, not to transform it or destroy it.","[society, constitution]",government
11,Bernie Sanders,"These are the same people who believe, in some cases, the federal government should not play any role in providing health care to our people or protecting the environment.","[health, believe, environment]",government
12,James Dyson,"Engineering undergraduates should not be charged fees. They should receive grants, not student loans, and the government will get the money back long-term from increased exports.","[money, engineering, student]",government
13,Lynne Reid Banks,"The '50s in general are written off as a boring decade following the turmoil of the Second World War and its immediate aftermath - the postwar Labour government, the cold war, the arrival of the New Look in fashion, etc. But I remember it as a very exciting time - a pioneering, rule-breaking time, especially for the young.","[time, war, world]",government
14,Stanley Ho,"Because I became a refugee in Macau during 1941, we had this war in Hong Kong, I fought for the government as an air raid warden for 15 days. Our government surrendered, Hong Kong Government surrendered, so I took a junk and came to Macau in 16 hours and I was a refugee, so that's why I was so much indebted to Macau.","[war, why, refugee]",government
15,Upamanyu Chatterjee,"Governance is complex, difficult, and on the whole, thankless - why ever should the Bright Young Things leave the management of their hotels, newspapers, banks, TV channels and corporations to join, like fleas on a behemoth, the government? Wherein lies the difference between the two worlds?","[management, difficult, young]",government
16,Lysander Spooner,"Any government, that is its own judge of, and determines authoritatively for the people, what are its own powers over the people, is an absolute government of course. It has all the powers that it chooses to exercise. There is no other or at least no more accurate definition of a despotism than this.","[people, exercise, judge]",government
17,Lysander Spooner,"The right of revolution, which tyrants, in mockery, accord to mankind, is no legal right under a government; it is only a natural right to overturn a government.","[legal, revolution, right]",government
18,Lysander Spooner,The secret ballot makes a secret government; and a secret government is a secret band of robbers and murderers.,"[band, secret, makes]",government
19,Lysander Spooner,"If taxation without consent is robbery, the United States government has never had, has not now, and is never likely to have, a single honest dollar in its treasury. If taxation without consent is not robbery, then any band of robbers have only to declare themselves a government, and all their robberies are legalized.","[band, honest, single]",government
20,Lysander Spooner,"A man's natural rights are his own, against the whole world; and any infringement of them is equally a crime, whether committed by one man, or by millions; whether committed by one man, calling himself a robber, (or by any other name indicating his true character,) or by millions, calling themselves a government.","[character, man, world]",government
21,Lysander Spooner,"A government that can at pleasure accuse, shoot, and hang men, as traitors, for the one general offence of refusing to surrender themselves and their property unreservedly to its arbitrary will, can practice any and all special and particular oppressions it pleases.","[men, practice, special]",government

23,Bill Bryson,"There'd never been a more advantageous time to be a criminal in America than during the 13 years of Prohibition. At a stroke, the American government closed down the fifth largest industry in the United States - alcohol production - and just handed it to criminals - a pretty remarkable thing to do.","[time, america, prohibition]",government
