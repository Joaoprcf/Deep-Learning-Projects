4,Amy Sedaris,You think in a different way when you don't have any money. The joy of poverty is that you use your imagination to come up with stuff.,"[money, joy, poverty]",imagination
5,Nicole Kidman,"My parents thought it was nice to develop my imagination, but they never seriously thought that anything would ever come of it.

6,Sonam Kapoor,"I don't think most books can be justifiably translated on screen. The film versions can't convey the right emotion, fuel your imagination or allow you to visualise every line the way books do.","[think, way, you]",imagination
7,Sonam Kapoor,"I didn't like Barbie dolls, so I used to have this overactive imagination, and I used to pretend to be all these different things. My weird childhood fetishes seem to have come to life now as an actor.","[life, childhood, weird]",imagination
8,Sonam Kapoor,"My mom would always read a book to me at night from when I was three. Now, I can't go to sleep without reading a book. At the same time, once I read, it's difficult for me to go to sleep, as I have an overactive imagination and I start thinking.","[time, mom, sleep]",imagination
9,Joshua Oppenheimer,"I think Direct Cinema's trying to be insightful by looking at reality in a very close way while, in fact, much more is staged than we like to think. In cinema verite, it's about trying to make something invisible visible - the role of fantasy and imagination in everyday life.","[life, reality, looking]",imagination
10,Jill Lepore,"The study of history requires investigation, imagination, empathy, and respect. Reverence just doesn't enter into it.","[respect, history, empathy]",imagination
11,Ahmed Zewail,"Syria may appear to be a small country, but it is just the type of entangled conflict that can lead to a world catastrophe. It does not take much imagination to see Syria as the Sarajevo of the 21st century, leading to world war.","[war, conflict, small]",imagination
12,Thomas Huxley,The scientific imagination always restrains itself within the limits of probability.,"[limits, within, always]",imagination
13,Idris Elba,"There's the argument that you can relate to someone who's completely unrelatable. In the way that a director shows you his imagination on a film, then I get to show you my imagination in a big dumb character.","[character, someone, argument]",imagination
14,Orhan Pamuk,I have always thought that the place where you sleep or the place you share with your partner should be separate from the place where you write. The domestic rituals and details somehow kill the imagination. They kill the demon in me.,"[sleep, thought, me]",imagination
15,Orhan Pamuk,"Authoritarianism, an unrealistic occidental imagination - these issues will never be settled. Turkey will continue to take Europe as a model; it will continue to pursue its search for democracy.","[democracy, search, europe]",imagination
16,Orhan Pamuk,"The fictive structure, my work, my imagination, my books are about the details, the huge construction about culture, Islamic culture or modern Turkey. They're all intertwined.","[work, culture, construction]",imagination
17,Orhan Pamuk,"If I think back on the books to which I have devoted my entire life, I am most surprised by those moments when I have felt as if the sentences, dreams, and pages that have made me so ecstatically happy have not come from my own imagination - that another power has found them and generously presented them to me.","[life, dreams, happy]",imagination

19,Nathan Fillion,"I think my printing to this day looks like the printing right out of a comic book. Actually, I always wanted to be in a comic book. I watched cartoons when I was a kid, too, and both comics and cartoons lit fire in my imagination. This realm holds a lot of interest for me, a lot of passion for me. So to be comic-ized, yeah, that's cool.","[passion, cool, day]",imagination
20,Georg C. Lichtenberg,The pleasures of the imagination are as it were only drawings and models which are played with by poor people who cannot afford the real thing.,"[people, poor people, poor]",imagination
21,John Hurt,"I'm essentially the result of other people's imagination. And that's fine. Because of other people's imagination, I've played parts I would never have thought I could do. Still, I've never had a hankering or an ambition for any particular role.","[ambition, people, thought]",imagination
22,Frank Lloyd Wright,An idea is salvation by imagination.,"[salvation, idea]",imagination
23,Ta-Nehisi Coates,"Superheroes are best imagined in comic books. The union between the written word, the image, and then what your imagination has to do to connect those allows for so much.","[best, image, word]",imagination
24,Ta-Nehisi Coates,"When I see Bruce Banner becoming the Hulk, it's only a picture. My imagination has to do some of the work there, to impute feeling and everything. We're talking about something that's so surreal, it's just not possible within the world as we know it. So that requires a form that is not so literal.","[work, world, know]",imagination
25,Lindsey Stirling,"Visualization - it's been huge for me. Your mind doesn't know the difference between imagination and reality. You can't always practice perfectly - my fingers will play a little bit out of tune, or my dance moves might not be as sharp - but in my mind, I can practice perfectly.","[mind, dance, reality]",imagination
