4,Mahatma Gandhi,"I did once seriously think of embracing the Christian faith.

6,C. S. Lewis,"Nothing is more dangerous to one's own faith than the work of an apologist. No doctrine of that faith seems to me so spectral, so unreal as one that I have just successfully defended in a public debate.","[work, me, debate]",faith
7,Wayne Dyer,Faith is the complete reliance on the power and goodness of Spirit and the firm belief that you are always connected to this goodness. Always affirm your faith and not your doubt.,"[power, doubt, belief]",faith

12,Anne Graham Lotz,"One misconception is that if we follow God in the life of faith, and that means obedience - that we read His Word, we're obedient, we pray, we go to church, we do the right things - that somehow His blessing means we're going to be okay.","[life, god, blessing]",faith

I have seen a lot of people getting tattoos just because it's a trend.","[love, myself, discipline]",faith
16,Martin Luther,"Faith must trample under foot all reason, sense, and understanding.","[understanding, reason, foot]",faith
17,Bill Nye,"I really believe in science. It is a faith. It is a reverence akin to religion. But as we always say, it's different from religion in that, as near as we can tell, it exists outside of us. It has an objective quality, the process of science.","[science, religion, believe]",faith
