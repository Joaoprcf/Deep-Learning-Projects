6,Frank Gehry,"Architecture has always been a very idealistic profession. It's about making the world a better place, and it works over the generations because people go on vacation and they look for it.","[vacation, world, people]",architecture
7,Frank Gehry,"I think people care. If not, why do so many people spend money going on vacations to see architecture? They go to the Parthenon, to Chartres, to the Sydney Opera House.

I just have always considered Illinois to be home.","[love, best, home]",architecture
25,Renzo Piano,"In a way I spend my entire life stealing from everything - from the past, from cities I love, from where I grew up - grabbing things, taking not only from architecture but from Italy, art, writing, poetry, music.","[life, love, music]",architecture
