2,Yo-Yo Ma,"The thing that I've always been slightly frustrated with, was that the idea of a CD is kind of confined to a material possession that you can put on a shelf. And the idea of music, for me, is always about both the communication and the sharing of content. And so the interactive part is missing.","[music, me, sharing]",communication

11,Emma Thompson,"Any problem, big or small, within a family, always seems to start with bad communication. Someone isn't listening.","[family, small, listening]",communication
12,Emma Thompson,"And it's absolutely true that male sexual behaviour and female responses to male demands change a lot when they start communicating - and the levels of the communication that I've seen on the ground in very, very poor areas are so high and I think why don't we have that here?","[change, start, true]",communication

Same goes for anyone else in any band.","[relationship, listening]",communication

16,George Lois,"All the people who run agencies, all the important people in agencies have taken communication courses, marketing courses, advertising courses, and courses basically teach advertising as a science, and advertising is so far from a science it isn't even funny. Advertising is an art.","[funny, art, science]",communication
17,George Lois,The 1960s was a heroic age in the history of the art of communication - the audacious movers and shakers of those times bear no resemblance to the cast of characters in 'Mad Men.',"[art, history, age]",communication
18,Jaron Lanier,"Anonymous blog comments, vapid video pranks and lightweight mash-ups may seem trivial and harmless, but as a whole, this widespread practice of fragmentary, impersonal communication has demeaned personal interaction.","[practice, may, personal]",communication
19,Ruben Blades,"I really think that music itself, being one of the greatest possible vehicles for mass communication, should be probed to its extremes, to see how effective it can actually become, which is one of the reasons why I became also interested in presenting political points of view.","[music, greatest, political]",communication
