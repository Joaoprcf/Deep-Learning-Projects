1,Bow Wow,"LL Cool J was a rapper-turned-actor, and I also relate to him because he was sort of a ladies' man and had a female fan base, but yet he's a positive dude. You never read about him getting into trouble or going to jail.","[positive, man, you]",cool
2,Bradley Steven Perry,"I know a lot of Disney Channel stars. I hang out with Debbie Ryan. Me and Ryan Newman hang out a lot, and I know a lot of them from 'Friends for Change' - we all meet from there. It's cool. Everybody is like family at Disney Channel.

3,Austin Mahone,"I thought it would be cool to Skype with fans on their birthday and spend, like, a half-hour with them. I did a couple of two-hour Skypes.

I've had a lot of people tell me I'm doing something no one has ever done before.","[birthday, people, thought]",cool
4,Rick Atkinson,The people who write official histories for the Army believe that a generation needs to pass before you can tackle the official history. It's useful to have some distance.

7,Serena Williams,"I've thought it would be cool to have a baby young. You know, be my road dog - like my dogs, they travel the world - but there's always something you have to give up for success. Everything comes at a cost. Just what are you willing to pay for it?","[success, travel, dog]",cool

9,Liam Payne,"I think the whole thing, boy band, it's a little bit of a dirty word. They say it's not a good thing to be in a boy band. We want to change that. We want to make the boy band cool. It's not just about dancing and dressing the same.","[change, good, want]",cool

11,Morgan Saylor,"I think it's cool to get to know designers. There is some anxiety, maybe, that after you've met a designer, you want to be loyal to them and wear their clothes.

12,Sheri Moon Zombie,I really fell in love with the art of making clothes when I was dancing on tour. Creating my stage image through clothes was a blast.

15,Ma Huateng,"At Tencent, we may be businessmen, but we are still chasing our IT, our science.

17,Lily James,"My mom passed down to me her old Levi's denim jacket. When I left it on a plane, I was devastated. I've never been able to find anything with quite the same cool, faded look.","[mom, me, find]",cool

23,Natalia Tena,"I love the fact that little kids think I'm a witch. A mum might come over and say 'I'm sorry to disturb you, but my daughter thinks you're in 'Harry Potter.' I'll say 'That's cool' and take the kid aside and say, 'I'm a witch. If you don't listen to your mum, I'm going to haunt you!' It's brilliant. I can scare kids into doing their homework.","[love, daughter, homework]",cool
24,John Ridley,"The great thing about working with NPR - and, really, there's like a million of 'em - is all the cool stuff I get to do for the public. Meet the president. Hang out at the National Finals Rodeo in Vegas. Drink a $10,000 martini.","[great, vegas, working]",cool
25,Bob Beauprez,"For too long, our country's version of an energy policy has consisted of Americans waking up every day and wondering how much it will cost to drive to work, how much it will cost to keep their business running, how much it will cost to heat or cool their homes.","[work, business, day]",cool
