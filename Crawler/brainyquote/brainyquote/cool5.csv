0,Orlando Bloom,"I'm trying to mix the cool, independent stuff with the big stuff, but it's been difficult finding the right roles. It's been an interesting ride as far as my career pendulum is concerned.","[trying, career, finding]",cool
1,Cynthia Heimel,"Never judge someone by who he's in love with; judge him by his friends. People fall in love with the most appalling people. Take a cool, appraising glance at his pals.","[love, friends, people]",cool
2,Britney Spears,I used to be a cool chick but I'm not anymore.,"[used, anymore, chick]",cool
3,Nikki Giovanni,"For most of my life, I've thought of myself as pretty cool.","[life, myself, thought]",cool
4,Celine Dion,I was not a good-lookin' girl. I was extremely skinny. I wasn't pretty. I wasn't cool.,"[beauty, girl, pretty]",cool
5,Michael Caine,"My problem was that I was blond. There were no heroes with blond hair. Robert Taylor and Henry Fonda, they all had dark hair. The only one I found was Van Johnson, who wasn't too cool. He was a nice, homely American boy. So I created my own image. It worked.","[american, dark, problem]",cool
6,Nate Ruess,"I think it's really cool, but Jimmy Eat World and Gin Blossoms did it better than anyone. People don't realize just how awesome the Arizona history is, especially for alternative music. Growing up, that's all I ever wanted to be was those two bands.","[music, history, world]",cool
7,Daniel Ek,"I actually bought a travel guitar, and that guitar is really cool. You can actually fold the guitar, and you can plug headphones into it, but it's acoustic, or semi-acoustic.","[travel, guitar, you]",cool
8,Paul Wesley,"I wasn't some weird loner in school, but I definitely wasn't invited to any of the cool parties.","[school, weird, loner]",cool

11,Michael Azerrad,"When you're writing, you're only a brain and some fingers, but drumming, you're involving all four limbs, and you're hearing stuff and you're converting your ideas into physical motions, getting physical feedback from things you are touching - it's pretty cool. It's a really a nice contrast to writing.","[writing, brain, ideas]",cool

13,Ben Silbermann,"As a kid, I always idolized entrepreneurs. I thought they were cool people in the way that I thought basketball players were cool people. It's cool that some people get paid to dunk basketballs, but I'm not one of those people.","[basketball, people, thought]",cool
14,Adam DeVine,"I think making friends is not being afraid to look stupid, because everyone wants a friend who is willing to be stupid and fun. If you try and be too cool, it only works in high school. After that, being uncool is a very cool thing to do. So just have fun, and don't worry what other people think of you and people will want to be your friends.","[school, fun, friends]",cool
15,Adrianne Palicki,"I was the kid growing up who would play with G.I. Joes in a pink dress and then run off to play with my Barbies.

16,Steve Gleason,"If we have a purpose in life beyond being a cog in the human machine, mine is to help inspire people and that's pretty cool. I would like to motivate the world.","[life, help, purpose]",cool
17,Kendrick Lamar,"Sometimes you have the trends that's not that cool. You may have certain artists portraying these trends and don't really have that lifestyle, and then it gives off the wrong thing. And it becomes kinda corny after awhile.

19,Lance Gross,"I'd rate myself an 8. I do have my flaws, but I'm a cool dude. If I wasn't myself, I'd kick it with me. I'm a down-to-earth person and all around cool guy.","[myself, me, flaws]",cool
20,Tucker Max,"I try to explain to people that the only way to be cool is to be who you truly are, and the only way to live life is to do the things that you want to do and be the person that you want to be no matter who that is or what that is or how you have to do it. That's the only way you can be genuinely happy.","[life, happy, live life]",cool
21,Stevie Nicks,"My generation fought very hard for feminism, and we fought very hard to not be labeled as you had to have a husband or you had to be in a relationship, or you were somehow not a cool chick.","[relationship, generation]",cool
22,J. Michael Straczynski,"A lot of the futuristic space stuff seemed to me to be a very cool form of science-fiction, so that was my first real baptism in the genre.","[me, space, real]",cool
23,Diane Ackerman,"Cicadas, buckling and unbuckling their stomach muscles, yield the sound of someone sharpening scissors.

25,Rena Sofer,"When I buy clothes, I like to buy them in outfits so I know they go together. I like a very simple, natural style.
