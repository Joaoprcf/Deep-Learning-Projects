2,Major Owens,It's a sad day when the leaders of the free world engage in such deception and trickery. I voted against this unnecessary war and will continue to argue that the best way to support our troops is to bring them home.,"[best, home, war]",sad
3,Laura Wasser,"If some people try to make a prenup into a pre-negotiation of a divorce... Well, that's really sad. But I do think that it's important to understand what each person has coming into the relationship, and what each person expects from the relationship. They aren't always fun discussions to have, and they can be very eye-opening.","[relationship, fun, people]",sad
4,Jill Abramson,"Budget cuts are a sad reality in most newsrooms, and I am concerned that they reduce the collective muscle of journalists who are doing the expensive, and often dangerous, work of on-the-ground reporting.","[work, i am, reality]",sad
5,Melanie Lynskey,"I like to play the grey areas in life - that's the most uncomfortable place to be. Nobody likes to be in that in-between state where there don't know what's going to happen. There's a lot of tension in that, and a lot of stuff to play with - where it's uncomfortable and awkward and sad and scary.","[life, know, happen]",sad
6,Ken Ham,"What is sad to me is not what Bill Nye thinks about me. What I found really unfortunate is that after presenting my stand on God's Word, there were a number of Christians who were more complimentary of Bill Nye than of me because Bill Nye was defending evolution and billions of years.","[god, me, stand]",sad
7,Merle Haggard,Everybody likes Johnny Cash. I think the sad part of it is his health is givin' him problems.,"[health, problems, think]",sad
8,Alexander Smith,The saddest thing that befalls a soul is when it loses faith in God and woman.,"[god, faith, woman]",sad
9,Gayle Forman,"It's not that we like sad movies that make us feel like, 'Oh, my God, what a bummer.' We like emotionally moving experiences. It's nothing new. It's catharsis. It goes back to the Greeks.","[god, moving, nothing]",sad
10,Helen Oyeyemi,"I remember that I used to get lots of books from the library, and 'Little Women' was one of them. And I used to just cross out the parts of it that really upset me because it's such a sad book in so many ways.

11,Tina Yothers,"With the other fellow actors who have gone astray, I think it's sad that society wants to label the business as doing this to people. It's really not true.","[business, society, people]",sad

13,Alison Goldfrapp,"I think some women try to make you feel you're not all female because you haven't given birth. There are a lot of prejudices. Some women think women who have animals are deeply sad, because what they really want is a child. Mind you, there's probably an element of truth in that.","[women, truth, mind]",sad
14,John Donne,"As virtuous men pass mildly away, and whisper to their souls to go, whilst some of their sad friends do say, the breath goes now, and some say no.","[men, friends, say]",sad

16,Kristen Schaal,"You go from nobody looking at you to people taking second looks. I remember really loving it - and then feeling so guilty for loving it. Like, 'That's gross, Kristen.' Also, telling myself it could go away at any moment, and I'd be so sad.","[myself, people, looking]",sad
17,Trevor Rabin,I belong in America more than South Africa. I can't remember the feeling of living there anymore. It's like it was in another life. That's sad in a way. It is my country. It's where I grew up. You don't know what it's like to have these negative feelings about your homeland. There are roots you can't escape.,"[life, america, roots]",sad
18,Helen Clark,"Well in the end the world can crank itself up to sanctions, as it has with Zimbabwe, another sad case.","[end, world, in the end]",sad
19,David Lagercrantz,"I have the deepest respect for Eva Gabrielsson and all she has gone through, but I also know that I make maybe her sad, and I am sad about that, but I make so many other people happy.","[respect, happy, i am]",sad
20,Lea Thompson,"My beauty secret is to try to keep my heart as open and happy as I can, because it really makes the sad lines on my face look better.","[beauty, happy, heart]",sad
21,Lea Thompson,"Cyndi Lauper's 'Time After Time' was a perfect song. It was so beautiful and so heartfelt. Her vocals were so amazing. And, for me, that was a song I went to when I was feeling sad and wanted to feel even sadder.","[time, beautiful, amazing]",sad

In my career so far, I have refused any song whose lyrics I haven't been comfortable with.","[small, living, career]",sad
25,Darlene Love,"When people come and see me, I want them to experience joy. I don't do any sad songs in my show. It's to lift the spirit.","[experience, joy, people]",sad
