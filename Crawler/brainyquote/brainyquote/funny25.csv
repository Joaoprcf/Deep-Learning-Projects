0,Jason Wiles,"I think on 'Third Watch' that I was the comic relief on a lot of that. I mean, I definitely had dark moments, but people tended to think he was funny even if the character himself wasn't having a fun time.","[time, character, fun]",funny
1,Maria de Medeiros,"People of my generation in Portugal fell into the magic potion of political ideas. What was very funny about this revolution was that it did not bring wealth to the Portuguese. But it brought language, ideas. You'd go to the fish market, and all the women who were selling fish would call each other fascist, communist.","[women, language, political]",funny
2,Robert Klein,"I guess I'm pleased and proud of the respect of my peers, and that when I disappear from the scene or from this earth, I will have left a mark. They'll say, 'He did it well.' I like being funny; it opens people up.","[respect, people, proud]",funny
3,Adam Rodriguez,"It was funny to run into girls I knew after the movie came out because they would say, 'I saw you on 'Magic Mike,' but there was this look of embarrassment. It was very cute.","[cute, magic, look]",funny
4,Peter Dinklage,"We, as Americans, at least - I mean, I love my country - but we're so self-righteous sometimes, in terms of, like, our nationality, our country. But we're people from somewhere else; the true 'Americans' are the original peoples. It's funny, but we're a very territorial species.","[love, people, true]",funny
5,Tracy Morgan,"I know my spirit is not mean, and I have a very good spirit and a funny spirit.","[good, know, spirit]",funny
6,Jim Murphy,"History often reads as a hard and grim experience. But people are remarkably resilient and funny, even when the going is very hard.","[history, experience, people]",funny
7,Dylan Penn,"It's funny because I've resisted acting as a career for most of my life. But both my parents told me if I ever want to direct, I should act first because no director should direct until they know what it's like to be in the actor's shoes.","[life, parents, shoes]",funny
8,Isabel Gillies,"It was a long time ago: 'Angela's Ashes' by Frank McCourt. It was a great story that was lasting, and I loved it so much. I also love Nora Ephron. I gobble up everything she writes. Also, I love Anthony Bourdain, very irreverent and funny.","[love, time, great]",funny
9,Lori Wilde,"'A Tuna Christmas' is the second in a series of plays created by Joe Sears and Jaston Williams featuring the fictional town of Greater Tuna, the third-smallest town in Texas.

10,Manny Montana,"I grew up a really shy kid, but I always surrounded myself with a lot funny people. It depends on the day - if I feel like being quiet, I will be. I'm not a complete goofball, though.","[myself, day, people]",funny
11,Sarah Silverman,But I think you can make fun of anything as long as it's funny enough.,"[fun, think, long]",funny

14,Kristen Stewart,I had to act in a school play when I was about ten years old. I really didn't want to do it. But everyone had to do it so I didn't have a choice. A talent agent came and watched it and later gave me some work. It's funny because I'd always known that I wanted a movie career. I just didn't think that I would be in the movies.,"[work, school, talent]",funny
15,David Heyman,"I think it's great to see how they've grown up, not just as actors but as people. They're still very much the same kids that I met many years ago. They've grown up and they are funny and wicked and naughty and bright, and I think as actors their work is just getting better and better. They've blossomed.","[work, great, people]",funny
16,Drew Barrymore,"The people I grew up around who I really liked were quick on the draw. It always just wowed me. And my mum would make weird funny comments. I can see in myself her self-deprecating, hippie humour. I can't take myself too seriously.","[myself, people, me]",funny

19,Rodney Atkins,"I've never really focused on if I had good habits when I sang or if I had bad habits, or if I was breathing correctly. So, I started doing vocal exercises and would stretch out before I sang, stuff to help my breathing. It's funny, you breathe your whole life then you find out you're not doing it correctly.","[life, good, help]",funny
20,Jacki Weaver,"It's funny in the U.K., where I'm not really known because I never did a soap. My English cousins in the Lake District think I'm not a real actor because they've never seen me in 'Home and Away' or 'Neighbours.'","[home, me, cousins]",funny
21,Oona Chaplin,When people say 'Charlie Chaplin' I still think now of the guy in the moustache and bowler hat and funny walk - I don't think of an old man who was my grandfather.,"[man, people, grandfather]",funny
22,Gene Wilder,"I write funny. If I can make my wife laugh, I know I'm on the right track.","[wife, laugh, know]",funny
23,Seth MacFarlane,If something is shocking without being funny it's hard to justify.,"[something, being funny]",funny
24,Lulu,"I have a crush on Steve Tyler. He's funny, he rocks, and has a voice like a god. There is another one who I have discovered can sing. I should try and make an album with him... it's Barack Obama!","[god, voice, try]",funny
