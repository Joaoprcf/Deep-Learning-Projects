1,Gary Paulsen,Adults are locked into car payments and divorces and work. They haven't got time to think fresh.,"[work, time, think]",car
2,Sheldon Whitehouse,"Rhode Island works hard to reduce air pollution in our communities. We passed laws to prohibit cars and buses from idling their engines and to retrofit school buses with diesel pollution controls. But there is only so much a single state can do, particularly against out-of-state pollution.","[school, pollution, island]",car
3,Miranda Cosgrove,"I'm more into, like, colour than, like, the type of car and stuff. I don't know much about cars, so I'm just more into picking the right color.","[color, know, right]",car
4,Zygmunt Bauman,"Partnerships are increasingly seen through the prism of promises and expectations, and as a kind of product for consumers: satisfaction on the spot, and if not fully satisfied, return the product to the shop or replace it with a new and improved one! You don't, after all, stick to your car, or computer, or iPod, when better ones appear.","[expectations, partnerships]",car
5,Joko Beck,"There are many people in the world who feel that if only they had a bigger car, a nicer house, better vacations, a more understanding boss, or a more interesting partner, then their life would work. We all go through that one. Slowly we wear out most of our 'if onlies.'","[life, work, boss]",car
6,Andre Leon Talley,"I will sit in the car on the way to a meeting and just smile. I really mean that. It helps you get through life. If you have nothing to say, smile. Look up at the sky and smile. Just be grateful.","[life, smile, sky]",car
7,Nico Rosberg,"I remember my father's last race very clearly when he drove at Hockenheim in front of 100,000 people and I was sitting next to him on the roof of his car and waving to the fans. That was the moment when I thought: 'One day I want to do the same.'","[father, day, people]",car
8,Rohinton Mistry,"Traffic in the streets of Bombay is chaotic at best. Riding a bicycle is a dangerous occupation. However, there are hundreds of them on the streets competing with the cars and buses and lorries because it is the poor man's mode of transport.","[best, man, bicycle]",car
9,Antoine Predock,"The connection to place, to the land, the wind, the sun, stars, the moon... it sounds romantic, but it's true - the visceral experience of motion, of moving through time on some amazing machine - a few cars touch on it, but not too many compared to motorcycles. I always felt that any motorcycle journey was special.","[time, journey, experience]",car
10,Noemie Lenoir,"I am not complaining; I had a beautiful childhood - we didn't have a lot of money, but there was always food on the table, and my parents saved money so that in the holidays we would all get in the car and drive to the mountains. I have amazing parents.","[holidays, food, money]",car
11,Carroll Shelby,The reason I moved to California the first time was to build the Cobra. I thought it was stupid to have a 1918 taxicab engine in what Europeans like to call a performance car when a little American V-8 could do the job better.,"[time, job, stupid]",car
12,Drew Carey,"I moved from Cleveland to L.A. with a girlfriend, we broke up, and I lived out of my car for a year and a half, on the road with nothing on my mind but getting my act good enough to be on 'The Tonight Show.'","[good, mind, road]",car
13,Allan McNish,"I think music can really affect people's emotions and, when I am about to get into a race car, I definitely listen to music with a good beat - that's when you've got the adrenalin pumping. And the time before you go into a race weekend, you have a lot of emotion and adrenalin, and a lot of focus.","[music, time, good]",car
14,Evangeline Lilly,"When I got the job on 'Lost,' I was a broke university student living in the crappiest part of town, with a duct-taped back window on a broken-down car. I existed on peanut butter and tea.","[job, tea, living]",car
15,Steven Gerrard,"When I leave the car park at Melwood, I try and become a completely different person. I try to get away from it. You have got to. Otherwise you end up like Jamie Carragher - obsessed!","[end, try, you]",car
16,Tom Ford,"I am a spiritual person in an eastern religion kind of way. I learned that happiness for all of us is a switch that you flick in your brain. It doesn't have anything to do with getting a new house, a new car, a new girlfriend, or a new pair of shoes. Our culture is very much about that; we are never happy with what we have today.","[happiness, happy, today]",car
17,Risa Lavizzo-Mourey,It isn't unusual to see children climb into a car every morning to be ferried to the front door of a school that's just a few blocks away.,"[morning, children, school]",car
18,Holland Roden,"I bought a car, but not just any car; I bought a Volvo, which was the safest on the road at the time. It's not any more, so I upgraded to the Mercedes.","[time, road, mercedes]",car
19,Clint Eastwood,"You can't stop everything from happening. But we've gotten to a point where we're certainly trying. If a car doesn't have four hundred air bags in it, then it's no good.","[good, trying, you]",car
20,Mario Andretti,"When a car's ahead of you, as long as you can see it, you get a tow, just like the draft in NASCAR. Even if it's a long ways down the track, it punches a hole in the air that has to help. When you're running alone, you can feel the difference, and it shows on the clock, too.","[alone, help, clock]",car
21,Vincent Piazza,"I think New York style is unique because there's something resourceful about it. Utilitarian. Whereas in Los Angeles, I find people make their cars a day closet. Which, I guess, is resourceful in a different way.","[day, style, unique]",car
22,Gordon B. Hinckley,"I hope that if you are employed full-time, you are doing it to ensure that basic needs are met and not simply to indulge a taste for an elaborate home, fancy cars, and other luxuries.","[hope, home, doing]",car
23,Akio Toyoda,"After I joined Toyota, there was a period when I drove more than 200 cars in one year - different types, other companies' cars. I want to be able to tell what distinguishes one car from the next.","[year, want, different]",car
24,Candace Kita,"One time, I was posing on a car for a calendar shoot. I was doused with oil and literally slid off the car, bikini, heels and all!","[time, calendar, oil]",car
25,James Corden,"The only thing I know is that no one ever sat in a therapist's or a psychiatrist's room saying, 'My parents just loved me too much.' The only thing you can do is love them and be around. Kids don't really care what your car is like or how big their house is. All they really care about is that you are around.","[love, parents, me]",car
