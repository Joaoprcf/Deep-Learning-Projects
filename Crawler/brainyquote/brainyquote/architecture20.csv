0,Robert Pinsky,"The last thing a young artist should do in poetry or any other field is think about what's in style, what's current, what are the trends.

11,Charles Jencks,"I'd been to Stourhead and was inspired by the perfect parity between architecture and art; in fact, the architecture is the art.

The artists should be working with the site, not just plonking pieces down.","[art, car, perfect]",architecture
