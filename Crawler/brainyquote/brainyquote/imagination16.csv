0,Emile Hirsch,"On 'Into The Wild' I spent months risking my life and on 'Speed Racer' I spent 60 days acting in front of a green screen. No danger to my physical self, but I sure had to use my imagination.","[life, self, my life]",imagination
1,Judy Blume,"Ideas seem to come from everywhere - my life, everything I see, hear, and read, and most of all, from my imagination. I have a lot of imagination.","[life, ideas, my life]",imagination
2,Gabriel Garcia Marquez,"It always amuses me that the biggest praise for my work comes for the imagination, while the truth is that there's not a single line in all my work that does not have a basis in reality. The problem is that Caribbean reality resembles the wildest imagination.","[work, truth, reality]",imagination
3,Francis Ford Coppola,It takes no imagination to live within your means.,"[live, within, your]",imagination
4,Cliff Martinez,I guess what I've learned is that there are no boundaries when it comes to imagination. It's limitless.,"[boundaries, limitless]",imagination
5,Michael Haneke,"To me, it's far more efficient to mobilize the imagination. It's far more efficient to hear a creaking step, for example, than to see the face of a monster, which usually looks ridiculous, and where you know that the blood is ketchup.","[me, step, face]",imagination
6,Ai Weiwei,"The Chinese art world does not exist. In a society that restricts individual freedoms and violates human rights, anything that calls itself creative or independent is a pretence. It is impossible for a totalitarian society to create anything with passion and imagination.","[art, passion, society]",imagination
7,Ian Mcewan,True intelligence requires fabulous imagination.,"[intelligence, true, fabulous]",imagination
8,Zac Posen,"There's not one major greatest influence on my career. It would be film and great artists and great imagineers - Jim Henson, Walt Disney, Charlie Chaplin, people who understand the joy of the imagination.","[joy, great, greatest]",imagination
9,Deborah Ann Woll,"I think it's fun to play with worlds that you can add a lot of your own imagination to. With 'True Blood,' you're not limited by anything, there are just leaps and bounds of the imagination you can take with these characters.","[fun, true, think]",imagination
10,Amy Waldman,"Imagination, it turns out, is a great deal like reporting in your own head. Here is a paradox of fiction-writing. You are crafting something from nothing, which means, in one sense, that none of it is true. Yet in the writing, and perhaps in the reading, some of a character's actions or lines are truer than others.","[great, character, writing]",imagination
11,Malcolm McDowell,"I think we're all a little afraid of the dark. If you lived in the country, as I did, there's nothing quite like country dark, which was really black. And as a child, your imagination runs wild.","[black, dark, child]",imagination
12,Iain Sinclair,"With the world as it now presents itself, there is something perverse, and probably dysfunctional, about a person who stays in the same house for 40 years. What about the expanding family syndrome, the school-lottery migration, the property portfolio neurosis? Have you no imagination?","[family, world, you]",imagination
13,Nassim Nicholas Taleb,"We humans lack imagination, to the point of not even knowing what tomorrow's important things will look like.","[tomorrow, important, look]",imagination
14,Raymond Carver,"A great danger, or at least a great temptation, for many writers is to become too autobiographical in their approach to their fiction. A little autobiography and a lot of imagination are best.","[best, great, temptation]",imagination
15,Marjane Satrapi,Cinema is a world of imagination.,"[world, cinema]",imagination
16,Thomas Sowell,I suspect that even most conservatives would prefer to live in the kind of world conjured up in the liberals' imagination rather than in the kind of world we are in fact stuck with.,"[world, live, kind]",imagination
17,Mark Sheppard,"It's the imagination that is involved in sci-fi, and fantasy is what draws me to it. Stories, everything.","[me, everything, fantasy]",imagination
18,Neil Gaiman,"When you're starting off as a young writer, you look at all the stuff that's gone before and the stuff that's influenced you, and you reach the ladle of your imagination into this bubbling stew pot of all of this stuff, and you pour it out. And that's where you start from.","[start, young, look]",imagination
19,Steven Spielberg,"I just had a crazy, wild imagination all my life, and science fiction is the greatest outlet for me.","[life, science, greatest]",imagination
20,Claire Danes,I've always had a really active imagination. Lots of kids have imaginary friends. Mine just took on a rather demonic form.,"[friends, always, kids]",imagination
21,Chiang Kai-shek,"As a boy, the very words 'Liberty Bell' and 'Independence Hall' fired my imagination and made a profound and lasting impression on my mind. Throughout my struggle to secure national freedom for China, I have continuously dreamed of the day when she would assume the full stature of an independent, democratic nation.","[freedom, struggle, mind]",imagination
22,Jason Silva,"For me, it's always a failure of the imagination. I have that anxiety that time is passing, that everything is ultimately fleeting and impermanent. I better take advantage of every single moment.","[time, failure, moment]",imagination
23,Cher Wang,"I always have this imagination, something I want to use. I don't understand the idea of leisure time.","[time, want, something]",imagination
24,Cynthia Ozick,To say that such-and-such a circumstance is 'Kafkaesque' is to admit to the denigration of an imagination that has burned a hole in what we take to be modernism - even in what we take to be the ordinary fabric and intent of language. Nothing is like 'The Hunger Artist.' Nothing is like 'The Metamorphosis.',"[language, artist, nothing]",imagination
25,John le Carre,"Like every novelist, I fantasise about film. Novelists are not equipped to make a movie, in my opinion. They make their own movie when they write: they're casting, they're dressing the scene, they're working out where the energy of the scene is coming from, and they're also relying tremendously on the creative imagination of the reader.","[creative, energy, opinion]",imagination
