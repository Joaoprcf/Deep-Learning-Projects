0,Willie Geist,"Like a lot of kids, I had a Superman cake or different theme cakes, but then I hit the age where I think my mom thought I was ready for the German chocolate cake that she makes for my dad.

1,Lou Doillon,"I hate short hair on men - the 'real' man is something I don't know. My dad was always playing with hairbands, making rings, while the women were wearing jeans, white T-shirts and Converse. That was the uniform at home.","[home, women, hate]",dad

6,Allison Williams,"I told my parents I wanted to be an actress years before I wrapped my head around what my dad did for a living.

10,Andrew Luck,"I was always impressed by how much my dad went out in the yard and played with me and my siblings when we were kids. I'm sure he was tired coming back from work, since he traveled a lot. But he always took time out of his day to go out in the yard.","[work, time, day]",dad
11,Ben Roethlisberger,I try to live my life like my father lives his. He always takes care of everyone else first. He won't even start eating until he's sure everyone else in the family has started eating. Another thing: My dad never judges me by whether I win or lose.,"[life, family, father]",dad

It was terrible.","[god, school, monday]",dad
14,Bill Belichick,"I grew up watching my dad scout games live. They played on Saturday. Sometimes they wouldn't get the films until Monday.

16,"Tyler, The Creator","Humans have voids, and you need things to fill voids... I didn't have a dad to fill that male model void, so when I heard Eminem or freaking seen Dave Chapelle, that's what I gravitated to.","[you, need, heard]",dad
