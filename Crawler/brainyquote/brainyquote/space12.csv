0,Paul Davies,"Astronauts have been stuck in low-Earth orbit, boldly going nowhere. American attempts to kick-start a new phase of lunar exploration have stalled amid the realisation that NASA's budget is too small for the job.","[job, small, american]",space
1,Burt Rutan,"Space travel is the only technology that is more dangerous and more expensive now than it was in its first year. Fifty years after Yuri Gagarin, the space shuttle ended up being more dangerous and more expensive to fly than those first throwaway rockets, even though large portions of it were reusable. It's absurd.","[travel, technology, year]",space
2,Larry Niven,Building one space station for everyone was and is insane: we should have built a dozen.,"[building, everyone, insane]",space
3,Sally Ride,"When you're getting ready to launch into space, you're sitting on a big explosion waiting to happen.","[waiting, happen, you]",space
4,Buzz Aldrin,"The purpose of going to Mars is for humans to first begin to occupy, permanently, another planet in the solar system. The astronauts or pilgrims, whatever you might call them, are going to be very historically unique human beings.","[unique, purpose, mars]",space
5,Simon Conway Morris,It is difficult to imagine evolution in alien planets operating in any manner other than Darwinian.,"[alien, evolution, difficult]",space
6,Chris Hadfield,"The world, when you look at it, it just can't be random. I mean, it's so different than the vast emptiness that is everything else, and even all the other planets we've seen, at least in our solar system, none of them even remotely resemble the precious life-giving nature of our own planet.","[nature, world, random]",space
7,Peter Diamandis,I don't think the space station is innovative. Going to the moon was innovative because we had no idea how to do it.,"[moon, think, innovative]",space
8,John Updike,What art offers is space - a certain breathing room for the spirit.,"[art, spirit, breathing]",space

11,Eugene Cernan,"Some astronauts describe the routine flushing of urine into space, where the freezing temperatures turn the droplets into a cloud of bright, drifting crystals, as being among the most amazing sights they saw on an entire voyage.","[amazing, cloud, turn]",space
12,Sam Kinison,"In the 1990s, it's OK to do comedy about the Chernobyl disaster or the Space Shuttle blowing up. It's acceptable to ridicule the Pope or the President of the United States, but God forbid you do a joke... about gays. The gay community is the last sacred cow in this society.","[god, community, society]",space
13,Donna Karan,"I love building spaces: architecture, furniture, all of it, probably more than fashion. The development procedure is more tactile. It's about space and form and it's something you can share with other people.","[love, architecture, people]",space
14,Chuck Close,Sculpture occupies real space like we do... you walk around it and relate to it almost as another person or another object.,"[walk, you, real]",space

16,Camille Paglia,"Madonna can still produce a catchy pop song, but she hasn't expanded her artistic vocabulary since the 1990s. Her concerts are glitzy extravaganzas of special effects overkill. She leaves little space in them for emotional depth or unscripted rapport with the audience.","[she, song, special]",space
17,Neil Gaiman,"A library is a place that is a repository of information and gives every citizen equal access to it. That includes health information. And mental health information. It's a community space. It's a place of safety, a haven from the world.","[health, community, safety]",space
18,Neil deGrasse Tyson,"If your ego starts out, 'I am important, I am big, I am special,' you're in for some disappointments when you look around at what we've discovered about the universe. No, you're not big. No, you're not. You're small in time and in space. And you have this frail vessel called the human body that's limited on Earth.","[time, attitude, i am]",space
19,Isaac Newton,"Absolute space, in its own nature, without regard to anything external, remains always similar and immovable. Relative space is some movable dimension or measure of the absolute spaces, which our senses determine by its position to bodies, and which is vulgarly taken for immovable space.","[nature, measure, dimension]",space
20,Bill Nye,I've always loved airplanes and flight. The space program was really important to me as a kid. I still have a photo of Armstrong and Aldrin on the moon in my living room.,"[moon, me, living]",space
21,Martha Graham,"To me, a building - if it's beautiful - is the love of one man, he's made it out of his love for space, materials, things like that.","[love, architecture, man]",space
22,Joyce Carol Oates,"If you are a writer you locate yourself behind a wall of silence and no matter what you are doing, driving a car or walking or doing housework you can still be writing, because you have that space.","[car, silence, yourself]",space
23,Jean Baudrillard,"Deep down, the US, with its space, its technological refinement, its bluff good conscience, even in those spaces which it opens up for simulation, is the only remaining primitive society.","[good, deep, society]",space
