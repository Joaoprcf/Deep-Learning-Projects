0,Laura Haddock,"I wouldn't say no to becoming a Bond girl. Making it in Hollywood has been my dream ever since I was little, watching Marilyn Monroe movies. To star in a Bond movie would be bliss on a stick.","[girl, dream, star]",movies
1,Emily Meade,"You grow up loving movies, and your first instinct is you want to be an actor, because those are the people you see in the movies. But when you actually become an actor, you're like, 'Oh, wait, this is actually only a small portion of the storytelling. If I want to really tell a story, I'd want to be a director.'","[small, people, wait]",movies
2,Josh Hamilton,The history of horror movies goes back a long way... of people trying to convincingly be terrified when looking at a piece of tape on the side of the camera box. I have a whole new respect for it.,"[respect, history, people]",movies
3,Hunter Hayes,"When I was in seventh grade, I asked my parents for a mobile recording system for Christmas, and I got it. I didn't come out of my room for years after that. I'd get invited to the movies and I'd say, 'I'm gonna finish a couple of demos.'","[christmas, parents, finish]",movies
4,Joe Taslim,"I don't take acting classes - I'm quite an autodidact. I prefer to learn from other actors by watching various movies. Evaluate my acting, spot the flaws and fix them.","[learn, flaws, acting]",movies
5,"Louis Gossett, Jr.","'Avatar' was gorgeous. There are good stories in there, but when used in other movies they're similar to those violent video games. Characters using deadly weapons. The children follow these movies.","[children, good, video games]",movies
6,Rinko Kikuchi,"I grew up with a lot of monster movies, robot movies, since I was a kid. I love anime movies, like 'Evangelion' and 'Ghost in the Shell.'","[love, monster, kid]",movies
7,Kari Matchett,"If only I could step back into the time of old movies, if only I could be given the opportunity to do what Katharine Hepburn did or what Rosalind Russell did. Those kinds of characters, that kind of patter, that kind of language, that kind of script. They don't exist any more.","[time, opportunity, language]",movies
8,Quinton Aaron,"I like to be someone else. I like to be someone other than myself. I grew up watching movies and being a fan of what I'd seen portrayed in the movies, and I always wanted to do that one day.","[myself, day, someone]",movies

11,Mario Van Peebles,"When young people see movies like 'Gandhi 'or 'JFK,' there is an element of romanticization of these powerful people, and young people often feel a huge distance between their own lives and the lives of these social-change heroes. But the Panthers were flawed-up people from the streets, so it's easier to identify with them.","[people, powerful, young]",movies
12,Karan Johar,"Whether or not we communicate it, I definitely seek my mom's acceptance and approval for everything. She has a strong commercial sense of movies and is a quintessential audience.

13,Kapil Sharma,"I grew up thinking that I would become a fighter pilot and was fascinated by aircrafts as I had grown up around that.

14,Bow Wow,"I'm trying to become a young CEO, to brand myself in television and movies.","[myself, trying, television]",movies
15,Rani Mukerji,I think the success of a film is very important to an actor. It depends on how many people go to watch your movies; the more the merrier. Nobody wants to do a film for five people. You work so hard that millions of people watch the movie; this is directly related to box office success.,"[success, work, people]",movies
16,Brian Bonsall,"I don't think I could compare myself to Macaulay Culkin, because we're pretty much two different kinds of actors. He's done a lot of comedy. He does mostly just comedy like 'Uncle Buck' and 'Home Alone' and 'Home Alone 2.' And I've done a lot of different stuff, like sad movies, like the movie about the kid with AIDS.","[home, sad, alone]",movies
17,Brian Dennehy,"If you're sixty-something, pushing 70, the chances of you getting a tremendously fascinating part in the movies are very low, as to be almost negligible, or even in television.

18,George Lucas,"There's no difference between movies and television. None at all. Except in a lot of cases, television's much better than movies.","[television, better]",movies
19,Sarah Silverman,"In terms of television and movies, I've been really interested in seeing the partnership of comedy and beauty and heart. I think they can go together really well and really thoughtfully. But, I'm a total one-hour drama addict. I think when you're a comedian, you tend towards dramas because that's the less stressful thing to watch.","[beauty, together, heart]",movies
20,Anurag Kashyap,"In India, there is a psychological problem that movies going to film festivals are boring. It is a problem with exhibitors.","[problem, boring, film]",movies
21,Saina Nehwal,"I do not fear anybody on the field or in society, but I fear at night when I am away from my parents. I am scared of the unknown described in horror movies.","[fear, society, parents]",movies
22,Kevin Spacey,"I don't care about my personal acting career anymore. I'm done with it. After 10 years of making movies and doing better than I ever could have imagined, I sort of had to ask myself: 'What am I supposed to do with all of this success that I have had?'","[success, myself, career]",movies
23,Francis Ford Coppola,"Without a doubt, I was born to want to make cinema, but the kind of cinema I want to make is not like commercial movies, which I enjoy myself, but I wanted to be the kind of filmmaker who wrote original work, sort of like a novelist would who deals with who we are and our times or our relationships.","[work, myself, doubt]",movies
24,Juliette Binoche,"Movies are open doors, and at every door, I change character and life... I live for the present always. I accept this risk. I don't deny the past, but it's a page to turn.","[life, change, character]",movies
25,Jodie Foster,"I think I'm drawn to films more as a director with a directorial mind even as an actor. I make movies to make the films, not to act.","[mind, think, actor]",movies
