0,Jonathan Sacks,"In thinking about religion and society in the 21st century, we should broaden the conversation about faith from doctrinal debates to the larger question of how it might inspire us to strengthen the bonds of belonging that redeem us from our solitude, helping us to construct together a gracious and generous social order.","[religion, together, society]",faith
1,Ray Comfort,"Faith is the first step to understanding. Either it's the Word of an infallible God, the fallible words of men, or faith in what you personally believe. You've got to have faith in something. Believe me.","[god, believe, men]",faith
2,Ellen Johnson Sirleaf,"The people of Liberia know what it means to be deprived of clean water, but we also know what it means to see our children to begin to smile again with a restoration of hope and faith in the future.","[smile, hope, future]",faith
3,Fergie,"There were periods of my life when a lot of people didn't believe in me. I still had faith in myself. I really had to ask myself life questions. Where do I see myself in five years? Create a ladder for yourself, and walk up the steps. Climb that ladder.","[life, myself, believe]",faith
4,Ron Pope,"We all know about love, faith, sadness, despair, hope, hopelessness, longing, desire... those are things we all have inside of us, and that's what my songs are about... what it means to be a human being.","[love, hope, sadness]",faith
5,Terry Eagleton,"Dawkins considers that all faith is blind faith, and that Christian and Muslim children are brought up to believe unquestioningly. Not even the dim-witted clerics who knocked me about at grammar school thought that.","[children, school, believe]",faith
6,Paul Davies,"We will never fully explain the world by appealing to something outside it that must simply be accepted on faith, be it an unexplained God or an unexplained set of mathematical laws.","[god, world, something]",faith
7,Philip Yancey,"Christian faith is... basically about love and being loved and reconciliation. These things are so important, they're foundational and they can transform individuals, families.","[love, christian, loved]",faith
8,Sharon Salzberg,"I think so many people tend to think of faith as blind adherence to a dogma or unquestioned surrender to an authority figure, and the result is losing self-respect and losing our own sense of what is true. And I don't think of faith in those terms at all.","[losing, people, blind]",faith
9,Randa Abdel-Fattah,"To the Muslim woman, the hijab provides a sense of empowerment. It is a personal decision to dress modestly according to the command of a genderless Creator; to assert pride in self, and embrace one's faith openly, with independence and courageous conviction.","[woman, self, pride]",faith
10,Adam Hamilton,"As a pastor, I have a deep desire to lead people to God and encourage people to pray, read the Bible, and carry their faith into every part of their lives.","[god, deep, people]",faith
11,Mark Batterson,"I think faith is the small mustard seed of opportunities every day. For example, 'Am I going to love this person? Am I going to share my faith with this person? Am I going to pray that little prayer?' It really is a daily thing where you seize those little mustard seed opportunities and then see what God does.","[love, god, daily]",faith
12,Miroslav Volf,"For Christian faith not to be idle in the world, the work of doctors and garbage collectors, business executives and artists, stay-at-home moms or dads and scientists needs to be inserted into God's story with the world. That story needs to provide the most basic rules by which the game in all these spheres is played.","[work, business, god]",faith
13,Os Guinness,"Beyond any question, the way the American founders consistently linked faith and freedom, republicanism and religion, was not only deliberate and thoughtful, it was also surprising and anything but routine.","[freedom, religion, american]",faith
14,Tariq Ramadan,"Fasting is, first and foremost, an exercise for identifying and managing adversity in all its forms. With faith, in full conscience, fasting calls women and men to an extra degree of self-awareness.","[women, adversity, men]",faith
15,Vincent Nichols,"Those who embrace belief in Christ Jesus are bound together in Him, in a real yet incomplete way, in his Body, the Church. Faith is never a solitary activity, nor can it be simply private. Faith in Christ always draws us into a community and has a public dimension.","[community, together, body]",faith
16,Ellen G. White,"When music is allowed to take the place of devotion and prayer, it is a terrible curse. Young people assemble together to sing, and, although professed Christians, frequently dishonor God and their faith by their frivolous conversation and their choice of music.","[music, god, together]",faith
17,Ellen G. White,"The great moral powers of the soul are faith, hope, and love.","[love, hope, great]",faith
18,Ellen G. White,"The name 'Seventh-day Adventist' carries the true features of our faith in front and will convict the inquiring mind. Like an arrow from the Lord's quiver, it will wound the transgressors of God's law, and will lead to repentance toward God, and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.","[god, mind, law]",faith
19,Ben Parr,"Google has placed its faith in data, while Apple worships the power of design. This dichotomy made the two companies complementary. Apple would ship the phones and computers, while Google would provide Maps, Search, YouTube, and other web tools that made the devices more useful.","[power, design, computers]",faith
20,Russell Simmons,"Respect your parents. What they tell you is true. Hard work, dedication and faith will get you anything. Imagination will drive itself.

21,George Muller,"Wherever God has given faith, it is given, among other reasons, for the very purpose of being tried.","[god, purpose, tried]",faith
22,George Muller,"Through faith in the Lord Jesus alone can we obtain forgiveness of our sins, and be at peace with God; but, believing in Jesus, we become, through this very faith, the children of God; have God as our Father, and may come to Him for all the temporal and spiritual blessings which we need.","[peace, forgiveness, god]",faith
23,Dan Brown,"Faith is a continuum, and we each fall on that line where we may. By attempting to rigidly classify ethereal concepts like faith, we end up debating semantics to the point where we entirely miss the obvious - that is, that we are all trying to decipher life's big mysteries, and we're each following our own paths of enlightenment.","[life, end, trying]",faith
24,Ezra Taft Benson,"Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ is the foundation upon which sincere and meaningful repentance must be built. If we truly seek to put away sin, we must first look to Him who is the Author of our salvation.","[foundation, meaningful, look]",faith
25,Saint Ignatius,"Among the many signs of a lively faith and hope we have in eternal life, one of the surest is not being overly sad at the death of those whom we dearly love in our Lord.","[life, love, hope]",faith
