0,Chloe Sevigny,"After having done this whole slew of press for 'Big Love', now I'll have anxiety dreams for like a week and a half about all the stupid things I said.

2,Angie Harmon,It's not like I don't have my own wants and dreams anymore - it's just that the kids come first. It's primal.,"[first, kids, my own]",dreams
3,Danica Patrick,"I've never been bashful to say that I'm not really interested in Formula One.

10,Jon Meacham,"I believe history will come to view 9/11 as an event on par with November 22, 1963, the date on which John F. Kennedy was murdered, cutting short a presidency that was growing ever more promising. Dreams died that day in Dallas; it is easy to imagine the 1960s turning out rather differently had President Kennedy lived.","[history, day, believe]",dreams

13,Karlie Kloss,"My dreams came true while wearing the opening look from the spring/summer 2010 Dior ready-to-wear collection. I will never forget how special I felt opening John Galliano's show, like I was living a dream.","[living, never forget, dream]",dreams
14,Junior Seau,Too many athletes are living in a tiny window. They have no vision for themselves - what they can be outside of football and what they can mean to a community. They just don't know any better. My hopes and dreams are unlimited.,"[community, football, vision]",dreams

22,Joe Cornish,I worry whether it's not really the best way to live one's life - trying to fulfill the dreams you had as a child. Maybe it's quite a backwards approach.,"[life, best, trying]",dreams
23,Lois McMaster Bujold,Seems like half my anxiety dreams are about airports.,"[anxiety, half, like]",dreams
24,Peter Greenaway,"I think that every artist dreams of renewing the forms which came before, but I think very few can be considered to have achieved that.

After all, even iconoclasts only exist with respect to that which they destroy.","[respect, artist]",dreams
25,Tim Cahill,"My first book was called 'Buried Dreams,' about a serial-killer, which was probably about ten years ahead of the serial-killer curve. It was a national bestseller, but it was three years of living in the sewer of this guy's mind.","[mind, book, living]",dreams
