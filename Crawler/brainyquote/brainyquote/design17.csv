0,Laz Alonso,"I love HGTV. I love working on my house and have really been bit by the 'luxury remodeling' bug. 'Million Dollar Rooms,' 'Million Dollar Listing'... any show that can give me design inspiration, I soak it in and try my hand at it. Home Depot is my second home!","[love, home, me]",design
1,Ken Adam,I always wanted to design for films.,"[always, wanted, films]",design
2,Olivier Theyskens,"I am interested in the idea of 'taste.' And by 'taste,' I mean opinion, inspiration and the craft of creating a personality through fabric and design.","[personality, i am, opinion]",design
3,Ben Parr,What can we learn from the battle between data and design? What can we learn from the relationship between Google and Apple? Clearly no one school of thought is right: Apple and Google are both wildly successful and profitable companies that changed the world.,"[relationship, school, battle]",design
4,John Katzman,I studied to be an architect. And I find tremendous similarities between building a company and the design process. Businesses have to do their planning on the fly in a fashion similar to an architect sketching.,"[planning, fashion, fly]",design
5,Rachel Lambert Mellon,I always design a landscape with fixed horizons whether it be mountains or a stone wall around a 20-foot-square plot.,"[mountains, stone, landscape]",design
6,Rachel Lambert Mellon,"The sky is a free asset in design, and nothing unnecessary should be planted that takes away the sky.","[sky, free, nothing]",design
7,Yigal Azrouel,"I very rarely wear suits, and only make one or two per season, so it's about wanting exceptional clothes that don't feel stiff. Fabric and garment washing are a big part of my design process for that reason. Everything needs to feel lived-in and comfortable.","[season, suits, process]",design
8,Yigal Azrouel,I always have music playing in my studio when I design. It really gets me in the mood and allows me to focus.,"[music, focus, me]",design
9,Charlotte Ronson,"I had always wanted to expand to beauty, but I knew I wanted to be able to translate my design aesthetic in an authentic way.","[beauty, way, always]",design
10,Peter Eisenman,I don't design houses with the nuclear family idea because I don't believe in it as a concept.,"[family, believe, nuclear]",design
11,Douglas Wilson,A challenge always is good. Normal design does not come under the constraints of a small budget and time frame. But it has helped me to make quick and knowledgeable decisions.,"[time, good, decisions]",design
12,Christian Louboutin,"I never wanted to work in fashion. At age 12 or 13, I wanted to design for showgirls - for the theater! And I was crazy for the Hollywood of the 1950s: Dietrich, Elizabeth Taylor, Jennifer Jones. They were my idea of glamour - and Sylvie Vartan, the French singer.","[work, age, crazy]",design
13,Michael Hansmeyer,"The traditional notion of an architect having a vision of a building and then drawing it either on paper or on a computer and then constructing it isn't really how architecture works, and in reality, the computer has a lot of influence on design.","[architecture, vision]",design
14,Neill Blomkamp,"I grew up as an artist. Science fiction allows for design and creatures and guns and all the stuff that I like as well. So I think most of the films I make, I'm sure, will be in that category. But I can also see myself making a film like 'Black Hawk Down,' and I could also totally do horror.","[science, myself, black]",design
15,Willie McCovey,"I had talked for years about doing a restaurant with Rocky Dudum, who's been my friend since I first came to San Francisco. Then Rocky's son, Jeff, said he wanted to design it, so he traveled around the country to sports restaurants like Mickey Mantle's and Michael Jordan's, and he came up with a great concept.","[sports, great, son]",design
16,William Gibson,"I like the idea of people who've had some success in one form secretly wanting to be something else; I have some of that myself. I look for it in other people who've established themselves in some particular art form, and then you find out that they really would like to design running shoes, or edit literary magazines or something.","[success, art, myself]",design
17,Clive Barker,"I'm not the expert on the great gameplay. I come in for the character design, monsters, atmosphere. I'm not the technician.","[great, character, monsters]",design
18,Donna Karan,"I design from instinct. It's the only way I know how to live. What feels good. What feels right. What is needed. Give me a problem and I will approach it creatively, from my gut.","[good, problem, me]",design
19,Donna Karan,"To me, design and style should work toward making you look good and feel good without a lot of effort - so you can get on with the things that matter.","[work, good, effort]",design
20,Philip Johnson,I wish someone would ask me to design a cathedral.,"[me, wish, someone]",design
21,Julia Roberts,"Every actor wants to win an Oscar, full stop. It doesn't mean you try to design things around how to accomplish that because that's impossible.","[win, impossible, accomplish]",design
22,Camille Paglia,It's aggravating that Hollywood has never gotten credit for the role it played in promoting modern design.,"[credit, hollywood, modern]",design
23,Richard Rogers,"I love cities, I spend most of my life talking about cities. And the design of cities does have an effect on your life. You're lucky if you can see trees out of your window and you have a square nearby, or a bar, a cornershop, a surgery. Then you're living well.","[life, love, living]",design
24,Richard Rogers,"Architects design buildings; that's what we do, so we have to go with the flow; and, even though I'm still an old Leftie, global capitalism does have its good side. It's broken down barriers - the Berlin Wall, the Soviet Union - it's raised a lot of people up economically, and for architects, it has meant that we can work around the world.","[work, good, world]",design
25,Richard Rogers,"A greater focus on design in all new homes would make the best use of land, create homes and public spaces, and reinforce the structures of urban life.","[life, best, focus]",design
