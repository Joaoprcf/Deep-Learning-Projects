0,Richard Louv,"Leave part of the yard rough. Don't manicure everything. Small children in particular love to turn over rocks and find bugs, and give them some space to do that. Take your child fishing. Take your child on hikes.","[love, children, parenting]",space
1,Kevin A. Ford,"Space is dark but, of course, when we're on the sun side of the Earth, we're in full illumination and we have all the reflection of the Earth below us, beautiful blue Earth and we're in daylight. Only on the back side, opposite side of the sun, it seems like night to us, too.","[reflection, beautiful, sun]",space
2,Ian Rankin,"I've always written. At the age of six or seven, I would get sheets of A4 paper and fold them in half, cut the edges to make a little eight-page booklet, break it up into squares and put in little stick men with little speech bubbles, and I'd have a spy story, a space story and a football story.","[age, football, men]",space
3,Adam Braun,"It always surprises me when donors who operate successful businesses assume that just building a school structure means that a community now has access to education. When creating a business, does renting an office space now mean that you're producing goods, training staff and generating revenues?","[education, business, school]",space
4,Liz Murray,"If I had a magic wand, I would live in a building in New York, big enough so my friends, my family could all have apartments in it. We'd raise our kids in the same space and have backyard barbecues and get old and fat together.","[family, together, friends]",space
5,Brian Blessed,"I have marvelous dreams! I meet Buddha, I meet Jesus, I meet Mohammed. I constantly dream of space, stars and planets: we are the children of stardust.","[dreams, children, stars]",space
6,Helena Bonham Carter,"In any relationship, after the first year is over, you can't help but want your own space.","[relationship, help, year]",space
7,Deepak Chopra,"Consciousness, rather than being an epiphenomenon of matter, is actually the source of matter. It differentiates into space time, energy, information, and matter. Even though this view is an ancient view, an ancient world view, it is now finding some resonance amongst a few scientists.","[time, world, finding]",space
8,William Shatner,"My fear is dying badly, through illness or injury. But what a glorious demise it would be to burn up in space.","[fear, dying, burn]",space
9,Neil deGrasse Tyson,"There's a lot to do in space. I want to learn more about the greenhouse effect on Venus, about whether there was life on Mars, about the environment in which Earth and the Sun is immersed, the behavior of the Sun.","[life, sun, environment]",space
10,Neil deGrasse Tyson,"I claim that space is part of our culture. You've heard complaints that nobody knows the names of the astronauts, that nobody gets excited about launches, that nobody cares anymore except people in the industry. I don't believe that for a minute.","[culture, believe, people]",space
11,Martin Rees,"There are strong reasons for believing that space goes on beyond the limits of our observational horizon. There are strong reasons because if you look in opposite directions, conditions are the same to within one part in 100,000. So if we are part of some finite structure then, if the gradient is so shallow, it is likely to go on much further.","[strong, limits, horizon]",space

13,Amber Rose,"When I was super young, I had an Atari and used to play 'Space Invaders.' Then I fell in love with 'Mario Bros.,' 'Sonic the Hedgehog' and 'Yoshi' on Super Nintendo. I was quite a bit of a gamer as a kid when I think about it.","[love, young, think]",space
14,Luke Nosek,"We believe SpaceX will become the world leader in space transport, and we want our investors to be part of that future.","[future, leader, believe]",space
15,Walter Reisch,"The ultimate aim of all science to penetrate the unknown. Do you realize we know less about the earth we live on than about the stars and the galaxies of outer space? The greatest mystery is right here, right under our feet.","[science, stars, greatest]",space
16,Tara Brach,"Quite simply, if you're feeling anxious, angry, a sense of shame, whatever it is, breathe in and agree to touch or feel it. Breathing out, offer space and care to whatever's there. If there's blocking to touching it, emphasize the in-breath and stay embodied.","[care, angry, agree]",space
17,Edwin Powell Hubble,"We find them smaller and fainter, in constantly increasing numbers, and we know that we are reaching into space, farther and farther, until, with the faintest nebulae that can be detected with the greatest telescopes, we arrive at the frontier of the known universe.","[greatest, universe, know]",space
18,Jamais Cascio,"When we developed written language, we significantly increased our functional memory and our ability to share insights and knowledge across time and space. The same thing happened with the invention of the printing press, the telegraph, and the radio.","[time, knowledge, memory]",space
19,Buzz Aldrin,"Instead of planning the retirement of the Space Shuttle program, America should be preparing the shuttles for their next step in space: evolving, not shutting them down and laying off thousands of people.","[planning, america, people]",space
20,Barbara Walters,"Before we had airplanes and astronauts, we really thought that there was an actual place beyond the clouds, somewhere over the rainbow. There was an actual place, and we could go above the clouds and find it there.","[clouds, rainbow, thought]",space

22,Carl Sagan,"It is far better to grasp the universe as it really is than to persist in delusion, however satisfying and reassuring.","[universe, better, delusion]",space
23,R. Buckminster Fuller,We are not going to be able to operate our Spaceship Earth successfully nor for much longer unless we see it as a whole spaceship and our fate as common. It has to be everybody or nobody.,"[fate, earth, see]",space
