1,Tom Brokaw,"Our friend, Timothy J. Russert, was a man who awoke every morning as if he had just won the lottery the day before. He was determined to take full advantage of his good fortune that he couldn't quite believe and share it with everyone around him.","[good, day, believe]",morning
2,James Comey,"Lives are saved when those potential killers are confronted by a police officer, a strong police presence and actual, honest-to-goodness, up-close 'What are you guys doing on this corner at 1 o'clock in the morning' policing. We need to be careful it doesn't drift away from us in the age of viral videos, or there will be profound consequences.","[age, strong, police]",morning
3,James Comey,"There's a perception that police are less likely to do the marginal additional policing that suppresses crime: the getting out of your car at 2 in the morning and saying to a group of guys, 'What are you doing here?'","[car, police, perception]",morning
4,Kourtney Kardashian,"I was surprised that everyone calls it 'morning sickness,' because it lasted all day. For me, it was even worse at night. During my first two pregnancies, I felt so nauseous all day that I could only eat plain toast and bland foods - no proteins.","[day, night, me]",morning

7,Natalie Dormer,"When I wake up on a Sunday morning with a slight hangover, in the gym with no makeup on, that's who Natalie Dormer really is. The girl next door who gets a spot on her forehead occasionally.","[door, girl, makeup]",morning

10,Bob Newhart,"I am one of the great wasters of time. I have made it an art form. I can get up at 8 o'clock in the morning, be out of the house by 8:30 and back by 5 P.M., and I'll be going all day long and accomplish absolutely nothing. It's an amazing talent.","[time, art, great]",morning
11,Paul Ryan,"And if small businesspeople say they made it on their own, all they are saying is that nobody else worked seven days a week in their place.

12,Rachel Kushner,"I usually get up between 7 A.M. and 8 A.M., have coffee, and go right to work. It's really important not to get sidetracked in the morning so I'm still in that dreamy state for my writing.","[work, coffee, writing]",morning
13,Marc Jacobs,"I don't know, but I always loved that image of a girl putting toenail polish on a guy - her boyfriend, or something like that. Or a guy waking up in the morning and reaching over and putting on his girlfriend's shirt. Like Keith Richards putting on one of Anita Pallenberg's blouses, or Courtney Love putting nail polish on Kurt Cobain.","[love, girl, know]",morning

15,Clayton Christensen,"I love my life as a missionary, keeping myself on the front lines.

For this I am grateful.","[life, love, war]",morning
16,Katee Sackhoff,"'Longmire' is an incredibly hard shooting schedule because the locations are usually an hour away every morning, and I come home every weekend. I fly back to L.A. for about 26 hours a weekend, just to touch base back at home. It's a lot of work. It's four really intense months.","[work, home, fly]",morning
17,George Foreman,I get up in the morning looking for an adventure.,"[adventure, looking, get]",morning
18,George Foreman,"Money is a good thing, but every morning you have to get up with something no one else in the world gets up with - that's that image. That face you see in the mirror, you got to love it, and you better do some things that you feel good about inside of you.

I quickly learned that food equalled love and attention.","[love, food, father]",morning
24,Stanley Hauerwas,"I was raised in an evangelical Methodist church. Evangelical meant that though you had been baptized and made a member of the church on Sunday morning, you still had to be 'saved' on Sunday night. I wanted to be saved, but I did not think you should fake it.","[night, fake, think]",morning
25,Albert Brooks,"I guess I was the class clown - with a name like Albert Einstein, you don't hide in the back. I'd read the school bulletin to the class, and I'd add activities and make stuff up. It was good, a good 10 minutes every morning.","[good, school, name]",morning
