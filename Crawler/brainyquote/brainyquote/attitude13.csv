14,Rory Kinnear,"If you look at a painting that you love by one of the great masters, every time you go back to it, you see something different - a different attitude or brushstroke. 'Hamlet' is like an entire gallery of old masters.","[love, time, great]",attitude

16,Michael Moss,"It's not just a matter of poor willpower on the part of the consumer and a give-the-people-what-they-want attitude on the part of the food manufacturers.

I could be myself.","[myself, girl, people]",attitude
