0,Brian Littrell,"I've received a lot of positive feedback from both the secular and Christian markets. People seem to be receiving it with open arms and hearts, and are interested in the stories I want to share about my relationship with God and my faith.","[positive, god, faith]",relationship
1,Daniel Ellsberg,"It was a good 15 or 20 years before anyone at Rand would be in the same room with me. They didn't want the question raised, 'What's your relationship with Daniel Ellsberg?' And not one of them wrote me a letter because they didn't want a letter of theirs to show up in my trash - which the FBI had been going through.","[good, me, want]",relationship
2,Mark Ruffalo,"My personal belief is that you carry your own water in a relationship. If you see a girl and you think she's hot, that's a very human reaction, but you don't go and tell your spouse that, you know? So in one way it's how you behave.","[water, girl, belief]",relationship
3,Joey Lauren Adams,"My life isn't that dramatic. My dad really loves me, he just can't talk on the phone. He's too crippled and shy, and that's almost harder. He's there and he loves me, and I try and try and try, it's just impossible to have a relationship.","[life, dad, me]",relationship
4,Joey Lauren Adams,My relationship with my father is pretty non-existent.,"[father, pretty, non-existent]",relationship
5,Allan Houston,"Seven years ago, my father and I realized that our relationship was extremely unique, especially in the African-American community. He raised me to not only understand the fundamentals of basketball and to try to be a player with a high basketball IQ, but he wanted me to understand that my image and my name meant more than stats.","[father, community, unique]",relationship
6,Emily Blunt,"I had a non-existent knowledge of Queen Victoria's early years. Like everyone else, I thought of her as an old lady dressed in black. My mom had told me about her, though, that she had a very loving relationship with Albert, that they had lots of kids, and that he died young.","[knowledge, mom, queen]",relationship
7,Melissa Gilbert,"Thank God I have four sons. The mother/daughter relationship is one of mankind's great mysteries, and for womankind, it can be hellaciously complicated. My mother and I are quintessential examples of the rewards and frustrations, and the joys and infuriations it can yield.","[god, mother, great]",relationship
8,Tori Spelling,I just want to have a great relationship with my child and have a great family dynamic.,"[family, great, child]",relationship

10,David Leavitt,"Having reached a point in which I was so bitter and exhausted from being a quote unquote public figure, I wanted to return to a more childlike relationship to writing.","[writing, bitter, exhausted]",relationship
11,Cynthia Nixon,I just want my relationship to be more for myself rather than a public statement.,"[myself, want, more]",relationship
12,Toby Young,"Oddly, I do have a problem with authority. I find it very difficult to knuckle down and follow rules. Which are the classic symptoms of someone who has a troubled relationship with their father. And yet, I never had a problem with my father.","[father, problem, rules]",relationship
13,Bob Corker,"It is not really our country so much is the problem, it's sort of the parasitic relationship that Canada, and France, and other countries have towards us.","[problem, canada, country]",relationship

16,Bob McDonnell,I think people are by-and-large happy with the providers that they have got now. They treasure that doctor-patient relationship.,"[happy, people, think]",relationship
17,Gennifer Flowers,"I have never lied about my relationship with Bill Clinton. The only proven liar, at this point, and the only admitted liar, is Bill Clinton; not Gennifer Flowers, not Kathleen Willey, not Paula Jones and not Monica Lewinsky, at this point. He is the only proven liar.","[flowers, liar, never]",relationship
18,Chris Cleave,I think that the relationship between two top-level athletes who are rivals is one of the most fascinating human relationships to explore. It's always one atom away from being a tragedy.,"[tragedy, think]",relationship
19,Margaret Atwood,I don't think the relationship between novels and realities are one to one. Of course novels play different roles. It's essentially just a long narrative form. What you use that long narrative form for can be very different.,"[think, long, you]",relationship
20,Salvatore J. Cordileone,"We believe that marriage, by its very definition, can exist only between a man and a woman. Moreover, study after study - not to mention common sense - show that children fare better in life when raised in a home with a loving father and mother in a stable, committed relationship.","[life, marriage, home]",relationship
21,Kevin James,Just me onstage with a mike having an intimate relationship with the audience. I don't get nervous for that. I just get excited.,"[me, nervous, audience]",relationship
22,Lynda Barry,"It's one thing to have a relationship, to lay your hands on it, and another to make it continue and last. That's something I haven't talked about much in my comic strips, and it's certainly something I'm interested in.","[hands, something, much]",relationship
23,Lee Myung-bak,"Yes, I don't believe that the inter-Korean relationship has, quote, 'deteriorated' since I assumed office. Rather I believe that the relationship between the two Koreas is entering into a new phase - a time of transition. And so I think that the North Koreans are trying to see what they can build with this, with my new administration.","[time, believe, trying]",relationship
24,Tony Blair,"In no relationship at the top of any walk of life is it always easy, least of all in politics which matters so much and which is conducted in such a piercing spotlight.","[life, politics, easy]",relationship
25,James McGreevey,"For me, living in the closet corroded my ability to have an honest, open relationship with my God, my loved ones, my constituency and myself.","[god, myself, me]",relationship
