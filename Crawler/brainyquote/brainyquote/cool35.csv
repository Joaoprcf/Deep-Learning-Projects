0,Richard Corliss,"Icy and earthy, Helen Mirren is a rare, regal presence in a movie age that values the plebeian over the patrician and mass over class. Lauded with an Oscar and an Emmy for playing both Queen Elizabeths, Mirren has matched her cool aristocracy with a boldness of performance and display.","[age, queen, performance]",cool
1,Richard Corliss,"In the movies, every crazy old fart needs a cool old car. Jack Nicholson drove a spiffy yellow 1970 Dodge Challenger two-door in 'The Bucket List.' In 'Gran Torino,' the cranky pensioner played by Clint Eastwood not only owned a 1972 GT Sport, he also used to build cars like that at the Ford plant.","[car, crazy, movies]",cool
2,Tom Felton,"I really liked the snake that breaks out of the cage in the beginning of the movie. I saw it in real life, and it was really cool. Really big and fat. The owls are cool as well, but you can't really pet them.","[life, pet, beginning]",cool
3,Tom Felton,"Draco's not really a bully. He's not exactly the biggest, strongest guy in the world. He's more a rich, snobby person. He thinks of himself as really cool.","[world, rich, bully]",cool
4,Tom Felton,"I would miss months of school and then return with bright blond hair. Needless to say, there was bullying. I wasn't beaten up daily, but there was name-calling and jealousy. You have to bear in mind that 'Harry Potter' wasn't cool. I wasn't part of the 'Terminator' franchise.","[daily, jealousy, school]",cool
5,Misty Copeland,"I think most people think of ballerinas as kind of either as a fairytale, far-away thing that's really not attainable, something they can't grasp, or they think of them as European or Russian and kind of their nose up in the air. So, it's cool for me to, like, sit with them and for them to really see themselves as me.","[people, me, think]",cool
6,Ice Cube,"I used to love to draw. I didn't want to go to art class because I felt that would be too corny when I was young, but architectural drafting was the cool thing to do because there was more precision. It taught me a lot about building and structures and doorways and frames and windowsills.","[love, art, me]",cool
7,Ice Cube,"'Boyz-n-the-Hood' was actually supposed to be written for Eazy's group. He had a group out in New York called Home Boys Only, called HBO. One of them looked like LL Cool J. Eazy wanted to write a song for them, a street song, like what we were doing on the mix tapes. So when I wrote it, it was too West Coast for them.","[home, doing, group]",cool
8,Whit Stillman,"My friends in Paris are writers, or something like that, whereas my friends in New York are doing cool stuff in finance and living very different lives. In writing, it's pretty solitary, so it doesn't really matter who's around.","[writing, finance, friends]",cool
9,Gigi Hadid,"I'm kind of the model that everyone thought would always be the Guess, 'Sports Illustrated' girl. Then, when I started to do high fashion stuff... people were like, 'Oh, so we can have a girl with, like, thighs and a butt in a Tom Ford campaign. Cool.'","[sports, girl, people]",cool
10,Gigi Hadid,"Rag & Bone is a big part of my closet. I just really like how their jeans fit; I wear them a lot, and I think they make really cool staple pieces.","[think, jeans, big]",cool
11,Gigi Hadid,"High school is when I started to get my sense of fashion together. My queen was Candice Swanepoel, who is a friend of mine now, which is kind of funny, but in high school, I was obsessed. I love her street style: she is always in cool boyfriend jeans, boots, and an awesome coat, which is very much like what I wear.","[funny, love, together]",cool
12,Gigi Hadid,"Fashion is really a place where every other industry connects, whether it's music or acting. At the end of the day, everyone is going to walk the red carpet and be interested in the fashion side of it. I think that's really cool because as a model, you get to connect with a lot of different worlds.","[music, end, day]",cool
13,Britney Spears,"Justin Timberlake is everything, and what more could you want in a person? He's funny. He's cute. He's great. He just understands. I get him and he gets me, and that's cool.","[funny, great, cute]",cool
14,Britney Spears,"The cool thing about being famous is traveling. I have always wanted to travel across seas, like to Canada and stuff.","[travel, canada, famous]",cool
15,Britney Spears,"When you tour, it's so hard on the body. Being in one place is cool. It's a more stable environment.","[environment, body, place]",cool
16,Britney Spears,"There are so many soulful singers, even the ones coming from London, like Adele and Jessie J, who are just amazing. It feels like a really cool time to be making music now.","[music, time, amazing]",cool
17,Britney Spears,"I do love Instagram, and my kids are with me, like, 24-7, so it's inevitable that they'll be on there. And honestly, I know it sounds weird, but I look up people all the time on it. Because I find people so interesting, and I'm curious about them. It's a gateway to meet new people. I think the whole concept of Instagram is really cool.","[love, time, people]",cool
18,Britney Spears,I'm definitely picky about what projects I take on. They have to be things I'm passionate about. I actually get to be creative when it comes to my mobile game. It's really cool.,"[creative, game, passionate]",cool
19,Britney Spears,"I would love to act. I would love to do movies. If it was the right part, it would be really cool... I love funny movies.","[funny, love, movies]",cool
20,Ty Dolla Sign,"My dad put me with all the greatest people. It definitely helped me now, because I know so much more about music and composition. It's cool. I love Pops. I'm super thankful for everything he's done to help my career.","[love, music, thankful]",cool
21,Ty Dolla Sign,"When we dropped 'Toot It And Boot It,' Mustard didn't even do beats, and now he's killin' it. So it's just cool to see all of my bros taking over.","[see, taking, now]",cool
22,Ty Dolla Sign,The softest thing I've ever heard are the wind chimes in my backyard. They are soft and cool and mellow.,"[wind, heard, backyard]",cool
23,John Cusack,"I remember once acting really cool on a bus with this girl named Stephanie. When I got home, I realized that I had a really big zit on my forehead. If you have acne problems, you really shouldn't be acting like Don Juan.","[home, girl, problems]",cool
24,John Cusack,"I remember once acting really cool on a bus with this girl named Stephanie. When I got home, I realized that I had a really big zit on my forehead. If you have acne problems, you really shouldn't be acting like Don Juan. I should have been contrite - and apologized for exposing her to the angry pimple.","[home, girl, problems]",cool
25,Canelo Alvarez,"I have to stay calm, cool, and collected.","[calm, collected, stay]",cool
