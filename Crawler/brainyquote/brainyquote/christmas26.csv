0,Mallory Jansen,I would like to spend Christmas in different countries all over the world. I love seeing how different cultures celebrate the holidays in their own unique ways.,"[love, holidays, celebrate]",christmas
1,Colin Salmon,"'Bond' was like Christmas: can't wait for it to come around. Being in the films brought me to a global audience, and I have had the opportunity to meet incredible people.","[opportunity, people, me]",christmas
2,Lana Parrilla,I loved 'White Christmas' for the music aspect. I was into musical theater.,"[music, loved, theater]",christmas
3,Linda Sue Park,"My first publication was a haiku in a children's magazine when I was 9 years old. I received one dollar for it! I gave the check to my dad for Christmas, and he framed it and hung it over his desk.","[children, dad, first]",christmas
4,Richard Roeper,"The truth is that our way of celebrating the Christmas season does spring from myriad cultures and sources, from St. Nicholas to Coca-Cola advertising campaigns.","[truth, season, advertising]",christmas
5,Kenny Baker,"I do enjoy doing pantomime at Christmas. If I didn't do it, I'd feel as though I was missing something.","[doing, enjoy, missing]",christmas
6,Dave Haywood,"It is always weird to be in the studio working on Christmas music in June and July, so we decorated the entire studio, we really did. We brought out lights, fake trees and decorated the place to get in the Christmas spirit. You'd leave the studio, and it'd be 100 degrees out in Nashville, but nonetheless, a great experience.","[music, experience, great]",christmas
7,Bailee Madison,"One of my favorite traditions is that my sisters and I, we all wear the same pajamas. I've even still got some from when I was 6. Also, I'll always remember cooking together in the kitchen and that no matter how busy our schedules are, we are all together for Christmas.","[cooking, together, busy]",christmas
8,David Eddings,"The unfortunate thing about working for yourself is that you have the worst boss in the world. I work every day of the year except at Christmas, when I work a half day.","[work, day, yourself]",christmas
9,Pippa Middleton,"Why not collect and clean chicken wishbones in the run-up to Christmas, spray them silver and use each to pinch together a white hem-stitch napkin?","[together, clean, why]",christmas
10,Luke Perry,"It's hard and sometimes it's scary. It still amazes my mother. I went home for Christmas one year and there were fans all over the front lawn, hoping to see me.","[home, mother, year]",christmas
11,Tony Bradman,"I have to confess that I've never been a great fan of Christmas or, as it's known in our house, The Monster That Ate the Last Third of the Year. It's mostly the rampant consumerism I object to, but I'm also a little wary of the annual crop of new Christmas stories and sometimes wonder why anyone bothers.","[great, year, sometimes]",christmas
12,Thomas Brodie-Sangster,"I'm not a fan of musicals at all, but I do think 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' is a very good. I always thought 'Walk the Line' was very good, too.","[good, thought, walk]",christmas
13,Steve Israel,I actually share her view and understand her frustration when any government attempts to ban secular symbols like Santa Claus or Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer or Christmas lights.,"[santa, government, red]",christmas
14,Joy Bryant,"I hate Christmas, really. I don't really give presents away or expect any.","[hate, expect, away]",christmas

16,Tove Jansson,"On the morning, Daddy and I get up at six o'clock because Christmas trees must be bought in the dark. We walk to the other end of town, as the big harbour is just the right setting for buying a Christmas tree. We spend hours choosing, looking at every branch suspiciously. It's always cold.","[morning, end, tree]",christmas
17,Tove Jansson,"Mummy weighed sweets and nuts so that everyone would get exactly the same amount. During the year, everything is measured roughly, but at Christmas, it has to be absolutely fair. That's why it's such a strenuous time.","[time, year, everyone]",christmas
18,Tove Jansson,"Nothing is as peaceful as when Christmas is over, when one has been forgiven for everything and can be normal again.","[nothing, peaceful]",christmas
19,David Ayer,"My father died when I was really young, on Christmas Day.","[father, day, young]",christmas

21,Melanie Brown,I'm well-travelled so I can see places coming up. I went to St. Croix in the West Indies at Christmas and it had been hit by a really bad tornado. Values there have gone down but I guarantee they will be up again in eight years. So I'll get in now while it's cheap as chips.,"[down, values, see]",christmas
22,Janet Montgomery,"If you're an English actor, and you're asked to do an episode - especially the Christmas episode - of 'Downton Abbey,' you can't turn it down. It's like, 'Of course!'","[down, actor, you]",christmas
23,Marie Rutkoski,"Throughout my college years, I'd watch my sister squeal every Christmas as she unwrapped another 'Buffy' DVD set. I didn't know much about the series, but I was filled with that obnoxious self-importance that comes from having decided to be an Academic Who Reads Serious Things.","[college, sister, know]",christmas
24,Ian McLagan,"I loved rock and roll when that came in, Bill Haley, Little Richard, Fats Domino, Buddy Holly, Elvis Presley, all those great records. So I begged my mom and dad for a guitar, which eventually they did get me for Christmas, but it went out of tune very quickly, and it hurt my fingers.","[mom, dad, great]",christmas
25,Rudolph Valentino,"The loneliest ebb of my life came on that Christmas eve, only one day after my arrival in New York. The abyss of loneliness. I ate a solitary dinner in a small cafe, and the very food tasted bitter with my unshed tears. One doesn't dare cry in America. It is unmanly here.","[life, food, day]",christmas
