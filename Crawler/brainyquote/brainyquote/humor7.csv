1,Peter Steele,"Well, darkness with humor... I'm not an extremely suicidal or sad person.","[sad, darkness, person]",humor
2,Dean Koontz,"I like to deal with EVERY aspect of our condition, and that means terror and humor in equal mix. Some books have more room for humor than others.","[equal, others, room]",humor
3,Ludwig Wittgenstein,"Humor is not a mood but a way of looking at the world. So if it is correct to say that humor was stamped out in Nazi Germany, that does not mean that people were not in good spirits, or anything of that sort, but something much deeper and more important.","[good, world, people]",humor
4,Robin Roberts,The combination of landing the biggest interview of my career and having a drill in my back reminds me that God only gives us what we can handle and that it helps to have a good sense of humor when we run smack into the absurdity of life.,"[life, god, good]",humor
5,Anne Lamott,"We can't understand when we're pregnant, or when our siblings are expecting, how profound it is to have a shared history with a younger generation: blood, genes, humor. It means we were actually here, on Earth, for a time - like the Egyptians with their pyramids, only with children.","[time, history, children]",humor
6,Marlo Thomas,"The rejection that we all take and the sadness and the aggravation and the loss of jobs and all of the things that we live through in our lives, without a sense of humor, I don't know how people make it.","[sadness, loss, people]",humor
7,Carmen Electra,"I want someone who can keep me on my toes, has a good sense of humor and a good heart.","[good, heart, me]",humor
8,Adam Carolla,"The reason why you know more funny dudes than funny chicks is that dudes are funnier than chicks. If my daughter has a mediocre sense of humor, I'm just gonna tell her, 'Be a staff writer for a sitcom. Because they'll have to hire you, they can't really fire you, and you don't have to produce that much. It'll be awesome.'","[funny, daughter, fire]",humor
9,Alexander Payne,"I get asked, 'How can you have such failures in your films?' Well, what else is life about? There's some sense of constant failure in something. Humor gives you a distance from it.","[life, failure, you]",humor
10,Betty White,"I like bawdy humor. I love bawdy humor, but not dirty humor.","[love, dirty, like]",humor
11,Josh Gad,"I was a product of a divorced family and I used humor as a weapon to combat sadness. I used comedy to make my mother laugh in light of the darkness that she faced, and to me it became a very powerful tool at a very young age, at six. I saw how therapeutic it could be.","[family, light, age]",humor
12,Sloane Crosley,"It's funny. People often compare me to other humor essayists. They're usually quite nice comparisons; I will accept those gladly. But I am always sort of appalled at the idea of being lumped with other, more chick-y female writers. And the truth is probably that neither comparison is accurate.","[funny, truth, i am]",humor
13,Richard Lederer,I think the humor of double puns is incredible.,"[think, double, i think]",humor
14,Denis Leary,"My dad was very much a John Wayne kind of guy, but he was also a great guy, great sense of humor, a real dedicated dad. I don't think he ever missed a hockey game I was in.","[dad, great, hockey]",humor
15,Jonathan Winters,"The most terrible fear that anybody should have is not war, is not a disease, not cancer or heart problems or food poisoning - it's a man or a woman without a sense of humor.","[food, war, fear]",humor
16,Edward de Bono,"Humor is probably the most significant characteristics of the human mind. Far more significant than reason. In fact, reason is actually a very cheap commodity.","[mind, reason, human mind]",humor
17,Mort Sahl,"Professional comedians, surprisingly, have a lack of humor. They're insensitive to the insanity of our times.","[insanity, professional]",humor
18,Mort Sahl,"I didn't think that anything is beyond humor - not profane humor, but a good, honest approach to humor.","[good, think, beyond]",humor
19,Wole Soyinka,"There is something really horrific for any human being who feels he is being consumed by other people. I'm talking about a writer's critics, who don't address what you've written, but want to probe into your existence and magnify the trivia of your life without any sense of humor, without any sense of context.","[life, people, sense of humor]",humor
20,Michael Levitt,"I love the Swedish people for their detective novels, their archipelago, their sense of humor, their carbonated vodka, and most especially, for their wonderful hospitality.","[love, people, sense of humor]",humor
21,Bill Plympton,"I think it's part of the responsibility of an artist to shock, to upset, to make people think differently, and to surprise people. And that's where the good humor is, if there's a surprise and there's something unexpected. Something that's not normal, not in the realm of general living expectations.","[good, responsibility, people]",humor
22,Bill Cosby,"Now, Richard Pryor was unique. Many misunderstood his humor. He lit up the hallway, but they didn't understand his use of profanity. He didn't use it just to be using it; he used it in the context of his satire.","[unique, satire, context]",humor
23,Mac DeMarco,"I'd probably describe my sense of humor as 'twisted,' I guess. It's not hard to make me laugh, especially when I'm surrounded by my close friends, especially my bandmates.","[friends, me, sense of humor]",humor
24,Campbell Scott,"If you're playing a good guy, you show some darkness. If you're playing a dark guy, you show something different, like humor, that will mix it up and hopefully surpass the audience's expectations. What I'm battling all the time is complacency in the audience. I try to bring a little mystery to what might happen because that engages people more.","[time, good, darkness]",humor
25,Adam DeVine,"I still haven't found the humor in getting hit by a cement truck. My knees still hurt when I think about it, so no jokes about that yet.","[hurt, think, truck]",humor
