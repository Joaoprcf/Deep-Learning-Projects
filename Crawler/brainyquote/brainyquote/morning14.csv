6,Ed O'Neill,"When I read the pilot 'for Married with Children', it just reminded me of my Uncle Joe... just a self-deprecating kind of guy.

7,Taylor Lautner,"You show up in Paris, and on the drive from the airport to the hotel you're like, 'This is so cool! I want to see something! I want to go to the Eiffel Tower!'

8,Drew Brees,"I obviously take a lot of pride in what I do on the football field, because that has the ability to influence a lot of people. That puts smiles on people's faces. That gives people a pep in their step on Monday morning when they go back to work.","[work, football, monday]",morning
9,Carl Hiaasen,"I never laugh or smile when I am writing. When I come home for lunch after writing all morning, my wife says I look like I just came home from a funeral. This is not bragging. This is an illness.","[smile, home, i am]",morning

11,Drew Barrymore,"I still, at hotel rooms, I do this one sort of not-so-cool thing: continually shoving my room service tray in front of someone else's door. Because I don't want the remnants.

12,Chuck Schumer,"Barack Obama knows that to create an economy built to last, we need to focus on middle-class families.

13,Mary Oliver,"It's very important to write things down instantly, or you can lose the way you were thinking out a line. I have a rule that if I wake up at 3 in the morning and think of something, I write it down. I can't wait until morning - it'll be gone.","[thinking, wake up, wait]",morning
14,Jayma Mays,"My mom was a big 'Smurfs' fan, so she would force me to watch every Saturday morning. I had no choice in the matter. I would jump downstairs on Saturday morning, 'Hurray, cartoons!' and she would say, 'Smurfs! That's what you're watching.'","[mom, me, choice]",morning
15,Stephen Daldry,"I never want to make a film. I don't wake up in the morning going, 'Ooh, I'd really love to be on set making a film today'.

17,Stuart Rose,"I actually think the whole concept of retirement is a bit stupid, so yes, I do want to do something else.

18,Christine Pelosi,"If have to undergo preschool safety checks every morning, why does a random thug get to own an assault rifle?","[safety, random, why]",morning

It all happened very fast, but it was super exciting.","[happy, monday, doing]",morning
20,Sophie Kinsella,"My earliest, most impactful encounter with a book was when I was seven and awoke early on Christmas morning to find Roald Dahl's 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' in my stocking.

25,Richard Lewis,"If you want to devote yourself to the arts, you'd better do it strictly from passion, because there is zero guarantee that you'll get anywhere. The hardest thing is dealing with business people who have nothing to do with your art. They could care less that you're up at 4:30 in the morning writing a joke. Don't expect any sympathy from anybody.","[art, business, passion]",morning
