0,Paul Ryan,"Obama is trying to paint us as a caricature, as if we're some bizarre individualists who are hardcore libertarians. It's a false dichotomy and intellectually lazy. Of course we believe in government. We think government should do what it does really well, but that it has limits.","[believe, trying, limits]",government
1,Clint Eastwood,I'm not really conservative. I'm conservative on certain things. I believe in less government. I believe in fiscal responsibility and all those things that maybe Republicans used to believe in but don't any more.,"[responsibility, believe]",government
2,Reince Priebus,"Obama sees everything backward. Where Americans see individual achievement, he sees government's work. Where we see failing companies, he sees innovation worth subsidizing.

3,Grover Norquist,"I run a taxpayer group - the most powerful guy in D.C., nonsense. OK?

And there are a handful - a handful of groups that fight for less spending.","[people, fight, group]",government
4,Grover Norquist,"The job of the government isn't to go around and try and make people sacrifice, it's to try and make people free. The reason why we have a national defense is to protect our freedoms.","[sacrifice, job, people]",government
5,Deval Patrick,"We believe that in times like these we should turn to each other, not on each other.

9,William Hague,"I think Britain would be alright, if only we had a different Government.","[think, different, alright]",government
10,Aung San Suu Kyi,Every government must consider the security of the country. That is just part of the responsibilities of any government. But true security can only come out of unity within a country where there are so many ethnic nationalities.,"[unity, security, true]",government
11,Aung San Suu Kyi,"My opinion is the greatest reward that any government could get is the approval of the people.

14,Iain Duncan Smith,"Thankfully, due to the United Kingdom and the commitment of the Westminster government we are able to ensure that money brought in, whether it be from the City of London or from North Sea oil, can be pooled and directed to wherever it is needed most. That is what being in the United Kingdom is all about.","[money, sea, commitment]",government
15,James McGreevey,"When I first ran for public office, it was with the passion and idealism of a young man who believed that government could help make our lives better, that public service was a calling and that citizenship demanded responsibilities. There was a greater good.","[good, passion, service]",government

20,Bjorn Lomborg,"Even if every major government were to slap huge taxes on carbon fuels - which is not going to happen - it wouldn't do much to halt climate change any time soon. What it would do is cost us hundreds of billions - if not trillions - of dollars, because alternative energy technologies are not yet ready to take up the slack.","[change, time, climate change]",government
21,Eliot Spitzer,"I have long said there are three distinct groups under the GOP's tent: theological warriors, who want to impose their social views on the rest of society; Tea Party zealots, who say with a straight face that they want the government to get out of their Medicare; and remnants of the pro-business moderates.","[society, tea, face]",government
22,Evan Davis,"We Brits print banknotes out in Debden in Essex, and have contracted it out to the private sector. Here in the U.S. it is a government operation right in the heart of Washington next door to the Holocaust Museum.","[heart, door, holocaust]",government
23,Brian Sandoval,"Unemployment, foreclosures, bankruptcy - the cure is not more government spending, but helping businesses create jobs.","[create, unemployment, more]",government

25,Simon Mainwaring,"It is time for corporate America to become 'the third pillar' of social change in our society, complementing the first two pillars of government and philanthropy.
