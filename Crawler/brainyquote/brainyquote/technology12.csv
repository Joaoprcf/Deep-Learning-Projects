1,Neil Postman,"I don't think any of us can do much about the rapid growth of new technology.

However, it is possible for us to learn how to control our own uses of technology.","[growth, control, learn]",technology
2,Richard Parsons,I don't think piracy is going to kill the music industry. But digital technology and the ability to download will change the packaging from CDs to a single-based business.,"[change, music, business]",technology

5,Nathaniel Philbrick,"A survival tale peels away the niceties and comforts of civilization. Suddenly, all the technology and education in the world means nothing.

10,Bethany Joy Lenz,"I love the romance of the '40s. It was the perfect time to live. Technology wasn't so advanced that it made life more difficult, but it was just enough that you can send a phone call or a telegram. And people still took pride in how they looked.

It's a habit like all habits.","[communication, brain]",technology
13,Margaret Atwood,People use technology only to mean digital technology. Technology is actually everything we make.,"[people, digital, mean]",technology
14,Dick Cheney,"I was convinced that eventually I would die of heart disease, that we'd run out of time and out of treatment, the technology wouldn't keep ahead of my disease. And now all of the sudden, when you get the new heart, your life opens up before you again.","[life, time, heart]",technology
15,Peter Cullen,"I'm always involved with the Aerospace Program and NASA and Goddard Space Flight Center. And if kids feel so inclined, they can log onto NASA and the Optimus Prime Spinoff Award, which we present every year to some of the brilliant young minds that are taking up into the academics of space, science, technology, math.","[science, year, space]",technology
16,Padmasree Warrior,"For me personally, the technology that has taken the most unexpected turn in my lifetime is what I refer to as 'the device formerly known as the cell phone.' I still remember many predictions that by 2000 there would only be about a million cell phone users. Boy, were they ever wrong!","[cell phone, unexpected, me]",technology
17,Marlo Thomas,"Despite our ever-connective technology, neither Skype nor Facebook - not even a telephone call - can come close to the joy of being with loved ones in person.","[joy, loved, skype]",technology

24,Martin Rees,"The scientific community should work as hard as possible to address major issues that affect our everyday lives such as climate change, infectious diseases and counterterrorism; in particular, 'clean energy' research deserves far higher priority. And science and technology are the prime routes to tackling these issues.","[change, work, science]",technology
25,Thomas Perez,"Everything has changed in recent decades - the economy, technology, cultural attitudes, the demographics of the workforce, the role of women in society and the structure of the American family. It's about time our laws caught up. We watch 'Modern Family' on television, but we're still living by 'Leave It To Beaver' rules.","[family, time, women]",technology
