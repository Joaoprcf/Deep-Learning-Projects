3,Bill Paxton,"It was so weird that I would end up directing 'The Greatest Game Ever Played,' because, y'know, I'm not a big golfer myself. But I grew up around the game.

12,Anita Sarkeesian,"As others have recently suggested, the term 'gamer' is no longer useful as an identity because games are for everyone.
