0,Andre Rieu,"It is a real piece of art if you can make a waltz sound like it is the easiest piece of music to play, because it's really not.","[music, you, sound]",art
1,Jerry Saltz,Anyone who relishes art should love the extraordinary diversity and psychic magic of our art galleries. There's likely more combined square footage for the showing of art on one New York block - West 24th Street between Tenth and Eleventh Avenues - than in all of Amsterdam's or Hamburg's galleries.,"[love, diversity, magic]",art
2,Jerry Saltz,"I love art dealers. In some ways, they're my favorite people in the art world. Really. I love that they put their money where their taste is, create their own aesthetic universes, support artists, employ people, and do all of this while letting us see art for free. Many are visionaries.","[love, money, support]",art
3,Kenny Scharf,"I always thought it would be a great thing to do an art carwash. So you can actually go and get your car washed, but while you're sitting around waiting you can walk in that hallway where you look at the cars going through the window, and that could be changing exhibitions.","[great, car, waiting]",art

7,Sam Kinison,Stand-up comedy is an art form and it dies unless you expand it.,"[you, comedy, art form]",art
8,Kailash Kher,"Music is the biggest tool of revolution - the best way to reach out to the youth and involve them. If you can't contribute to the world with your art, I don't see the meaning of life.","[life, music, best]",art
9,Trent Reznor,I'd rather not get into what I'm talking about lyrically. I think it's impossible not to demystify a song when saying what it's about. Music and art can be damaged severely by too much information; I say that as somebody that has participated in that.,"[music, information]",art
10,John Boyle O'Reilly,"With the advent of chivalry, the art of boxing waned. The evolution of feudal aristocracy, with other and widely different exercises, pastimes and weapons from those of the common people, made boxing unfashionable.","[people, advent, evolution]",art

12,Dorothea Lange,"Photography takes an instant out of time, altering life by holding it still.","[life, time, photography]",art
13,Fran Lebowitz,"Very few people possess true artistic ability. It is therefore both unseemly and unproductive to irritate the situation by making an effort. If you have a burning, restless urge to write or paint, simply eat something sweet and the feeling will pass.","[effort, people, sweet]",art

20,Ashley Madekwe,Nude nail polish wins hands down over intricate nail art.,"[hands, down, nail polish]",art
21,Neil deGrasse Tyson,"Let's say intelligence is your ability to compose poetry, symphonies, do art, math and science. Chimps can't do any of that, yet we share 99 percent DNA. Everything that we are, that distinguishes us from chimps, emerges from that one-percent difference.","[science, poetry]",art
22,Lewis Mumford,"The chief function of the city is to convert power into form, energy into culture, dead matter into the living symbols of art, biological reproduction into social creativity.","[creativity, power, culture]",art
23,Albrecht Durer,"As I grew older, I realized that it was much better to insist on the genuine forms of nature, for simplicity is the greatest adornment of art.","[nature, greatest, simplicity]",art
24,Edward Hopper,"Great art is the outward expression of an inner life in the artist, and this inner life will result in his personal vision of the world.","[life, great, vision]",art
25,Ha-Joon Chang,"Imagine if all those kings and dukes hadn't commissioned those crazy cathedrals, paintings and music... we'd still be living in sticks and mud. Because none of those things made any economic sense. Human beings' capacity to 'waste time' is a miracle - but that's exactly what art is for.","[music, time, crazy]",art
