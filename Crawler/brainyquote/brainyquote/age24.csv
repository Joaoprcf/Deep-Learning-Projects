0,Alvin Toffler,"The biggest tragedy I had was the loss of my daughter from neuromuscular disease in 2000, at age 46.","[daughter, loss, tragedy]",age
1,Mark Hoppus,"From a very early age, my wife and I told our son that there are times and places for everything. I told him, look, when you're in class, you have to be quiet and listen to your teacher, but when you go out to the playground, you can scream and be silly.","[teacher, son, wife]",age
2,Tom Peters,"Regardless of age, regardless of position, regardless of the business we happen to be in, all of us need to understand the importance of branding. We are CEOs of our own companies: Me, Inc. To be in business today, our most important job is to be head marketer for the brand called You.","[business, today, job]",age
3,James Rollins,"Fiction writing was in my blood from a very young age, but I never considered writing as a real career. I thought you had to have some literary pedigree to be a successful author, the son of Hemingway or Fitzgerald.","[writing, son, thought]",age
4,Carol Burnett,"I'm glad I was born when I was. My time was the golden age of variety. If I were starting out again now, maybe things would happen for me, but it certainly would not be on a variety show with 28 musicians, 12 dancers, two major guest stars, 50 costumes a week by Bob Mackie. The networks just wouldn't spend the money today.","[time, money, stars]",age
5,Jane Fonda,"We can no longer waste time and money. Every day, more than 2,000 girls in America, age 15-19, give birth - in the wealthiest, most educated nation in the world! Neither you nor I should accept this statistic.","[time, money, day]",age
6,David Duchovny,"In this age of media and Internet access, we are much more talkative than ever before.","[media, internet, much]",age
7,Mikhail Baryshnikov,Your body actually reminds you about your age and your injuries - the body has a stronger memory than your mind.,"[mind, memory, body]",age
8,Joshua Bell,"For some reason I can't explain, artist and musicians tend to look younger than our age. Being in music, you need this youthful sense of discovery and wonder for what you're doing and keep your imagination open. That's a youthful way of looking at life and I think that reflects in how you age.","[life, music, imagination]",age
9,Jonathan Sacks,"Religion is the best antidote to the individualism of the consumer age. The idea that society can do without it flies in the face of history and, now, evolutionary biology.","[best, history, religion]",age
10,Ezra Miller,"I don't know if it's responsible for kids of my age to be so aggressively pursuing monogamous binds, because I don't think we're ready for them. The romanticism within our culture dictates that that's what you're supposed to be looking for.","[culture, looking, know]",age
11,Brendan Coyle,"I would have loved to have been a footballer like my great uncle Matt Busby, but I knew quite early on that I wasn't going to make the grade. Luckily I was told by the age of 13 that I wasn't good enough. That's not a bad thing. You see this 'X Factor' generation of kids now who don't accept that they're not good enough.","[good, great, generation]",age
12,Josh Gad,"I was a product of a divorced family and I used humor as a weapon to combat sadness. I used comedy to make my mother laugh in light of the darkness that she faced, and to me it became a very powerful tool at a very young age, at six. I saw how therapeutic it could be.","[family, light, mother]",age
13,Laura Marling,"I feel increasingly like age is very irrelevant. Quite often, cynicism is confused with wisdom, and my scorn is confused with a knowing, which I don't have.","[wisdom, confused, feel]",age
14,David Mitchell,"In the 1970s and 1980s there was so little decent fiction for young people, but we're now in a golden age that shows no sign of fading. Philip Pullman, J. K. Rowling, Lemony Snicket are only three of the best known among a good number of equals.","[best, good, people]",age
15,Sissy Spacek,"Most things in my life I had before leaving home. Values, support, great family. I was shaped at an early age. A musician playing guitar, I wanted to be a folk singer.","[life, family, home]",age
16,Elliott Erwitt,"Everybody's got to do something... I'd been on my own since an early age and I thought I better find something to do to buy biscuits and stuff. From high school onwards I was earning my way with photography, one way or another, working in darkrooms and taking pictures of weddings, neighbors' children and so on.","[children, school]",age
17,Stuart Rose,"I actually think the whole concept of retirement is a bit stupid, so yes, I do want to do something else. There is this strange thing that just because chronologically on a Friday night you have reached a certain age... with all that experience, how can it be that on a Monday morning, you are useless?","[morning, experience, monday]",age
18,Tim Matheson,"You know, I'm a big comic book fan. As a kid I used to collect them until there was a horrible mudslide in Hollywood and I lost my collection, but I was also at an early age the voice of 'Jonny Quest;' it was a cartoon; so I am kind of a latent fan boy.","[book, i am, voice]",age
19,Gail Collins,"It's possible that you have been told a time or 10 that you don't appreciate how tough your elders had it. It's true that, if you had been coming of age back in, say, 1960, you would probably be feeling more restricted, if only because you were doomed to spend your days in a skirt, nylon stockings and girdle.","[time, appreciate, tough]",age
20,Megan McCafferty,"I do so much revising as I go along; I wonder how I could write books if I hadn't grown up in the computer age. I think I'd be a very different writer. I find myself cutting and pasting, changing things around and deleting whole paragraphs constantly.","[myself, find, think]",age
21,Stacy London,Your personal style should evolve with age. To say you want the same style at 25 as at 45 is a mistake.,"[style, mistake, want]",age
22,David Lindsay-Abaire,"From a young age, I was rubbing elbows with a very different kind of person and social class, and I felt a lot of tension and conflict in my identity because of that.","[conflict, identity, young]",age
23,Faith Prince,"I'll tell you something: my dad was a nuclear engineer and he was really bright, and I've always said that because of negotiating at such a young age with my dad, it was really such a gift because I could then negotiate with very difficult personalities - and not end up being the scapegoat. I learned to really pick and choose my battles.","[dad, end, gift]",age
24,Ben Casnocha,Talk to people no one else is talking to. Who would have thought that giving a speech at a funeral at age 12 would introduce me to a man who would introduce me to my first business contact who would introduce me to several other important people in my life. That's luck. That's randomness.,"[life, business, giving]",age
25,Ken Adam,What I felt at that time - we're talking about '61 - was that I couldn't remember seeing a film that reflected the age we were living in.,"[time, living, remember]",age
