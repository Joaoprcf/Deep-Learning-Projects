0,Bruce Lipton,Modern science is predicated on 'truths' verified through accurate observation and measurements of physical world phenomena.,"[world, observation, modern]",science
1,Neil Gaiman,"A good writer should be able to write comedic work that made you laugh, and scary stuff that made you scared, and fantasy or science fiction that imbued you with a sense of wonder, and mainstream journalism that gave you clear and concise information in a way that you wanted it.","[work, good, journalism]",science
2,Margaret Atwood,"Science is a tool, and we invent tools to do things we want. It's a question of how those tools are used by people.","[people, want, tools]",science
3,Buzz Aldrin,"There's no doubt who was a leader in space after the Apollo Program. Nobody came close to us. And our education system, in science, technology, engineering and math, was at the top of the world. It's no longer there. We're descending rather rapidly.","[education, technology]",science
4,Neill Blomkamp,"Obviously I don't want to make a film that offends people, but the whole world is so politically correct - I'm not going to not do something because it may be politically incorrect. At some point, the metaphors and allegories break down. They disappear, and you just have science fiction.","[world, people, want]",science
5,Steven Spielberg,"I just had a crazy, wild imagination all my life, and science fiction is the greatest outlet for me.","[life, greatest, imagination]",science
6,Al Gore,"Science has a culture that is inherently cautious and that is normally not a bad thing. You could even say conservative, because of the peer review process and because the scientific method prizes uncertainty and penalises anyone who goes out on any sort of a limb that is not held in place by abundant and well-documented evidence.","[culture, uncertainty]",science
7,Ray Kurzweil,"Science fiction is the great opportunity to speculate on what could happen. It does give me, as a futurist, scenarios.","[great, opportunity, me]",science
8,Oriana Fallaci,"What are the symbols of American strength, wealth, power and modernity? Certainly not jazz and rock and roll, not chewing-gum or hamburgers, Broadway or Hollywood. It's their skyscrapers. Their Pentagon. Their science. Their technology.","[strength, technology, power]",science
9,Alan Alda,"I read science, because to me, that's extremely exciting. It's like a great detective story, and it's happening right in front of us.","[great, me, story]",science
10,Alice Dreger,"When all is said and done, science actually takes hard work and a willingness to sometimes find out that your most cherished hypothesis is wrong.","[work, hard work, find]",science
11,Huston Smith,"I am critical of modernity giving science and technology a blank check as if it were the fountain of all truth. That is not true. And I think I may have introduced a word which has now caught on quite a bit, scientism. Science is good. It simply reports a discovery.","[technology, truth, good]",science
12,Huston Smith,"Science is empirical, all about physical senses that tell us about the world. But physical senses are not the only senses we have. Nobody has ever seen a thought. Nobody has ever seen a feeling. And yet thoughts and feelings are where we live our lives most immediately, and science cannot connect with that.","[thoughts, world, thought]",science
13,Neil deGrasse Tyson,"Innovations in science and technology are the engines of the 21st-century economy; if you care about the wealth and health of your nation tomorrow, then you'd better rethink how you allocate taxes to fund science. The federal budget needs to recognize this.","[technology, health, tomorrow]",science
14,Neil deGrasse Tyson,"In nature, when you conduct science, it is the natural world that is the ultimate decider in what is true and what is not.","[nature, world, true]",science
15,Neil deGrasse Tyson,"In science, if you don't do it, somebody else will. Whereas in art, if Beethoven didn't compose the 'Ninth Symphony,' no one else before or after is going to compose the 'Ninth Symphony' that he composed; no one else is going to paint 'Starry Night' by van Gogh.","[art, night, you]",science
16,Michio Kaku,"I am a futurist, projecting trends in science into the next decades and century, but ironically my two daughters - one is a neuroscientist and the other is a pastry chef - tell me that my taste in music is positively prehistoric.","[music, i am, chef]",science
17,P. J. O'Rourke,To mistrust science and deny the validity of scientific method is to resign your job as a human. You'd better go look for work as a plant or wild animal.,"[work, job, animal]",science
18,Stanley B. Prusiner,"While it is quite reasonable for scientists to be skeptical of new ideas that do not fit within the accepted realm of scientific knowledge, the best science often emerges from situations where results carefully obtained do not fit within the accepted paradigms.","[best, knowledge, ideas]",science
19,Charles H. Townes,The imposing edifice of science provides a challenging view of what can be achieved by the accumulation of many small efforts in a steady objective and dedicated search for truth.,"[truth, small, search]",science
20,Charles H. Townes,Much public thinking follows a rut. The same thing is true in science. People get stuck and don't look in other directions.,"[thinking, people, true]",science
21,Maharishi Mahesh Yogi,"The constitution of the universe is total natural law. 'Natural law,' we say from the field of science. 'Will of God,' we say from the field of religion. It's the same thing.","[god, religion, constitution]",science
22,David Gerrold,The first science fiction show on television was 'Tales Of Tomorrow' using scripts from the radio show 'X-1' which used stories from 'Galaxy Magazine' as its source material.,"[tomorrow, television]",science
23,Seth Berkley,"Science is one of the comparative advantages of our knowledge-based economy, and focusing on our prowess in providing better tools to address diseases of poverty is one of the best forms of foreign aid.","[best, poverty, better]",science
24,Martin Rees,"We can trace things back to the earlier stages of the Big Bang, but we still don't know what banged and why it banged. That's a challenge for 21st-century science.","[challenge, know, why]",science
25,Isabella Rossellini,"I was always interested in animals, but when I was little, animal behavior was still a new science. It was available to become a veterinarian, it was available to study biology, but not specifically animal behavior. In the '60s, Jane Goodall was the founder of this new science.","[behavior, animals, animal]",science
