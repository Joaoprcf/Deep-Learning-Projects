0,George M. Church,I always loved computers - it's something inside you.,"[loved, you, something]",computers
1,George M. Church,"We went from a world where almost nobody knew anything about computers to a world where almost all of us are computer geeks for a huge fraction of our day. And I'd like to see that happen with the digital world of biological molecules, too.","[day, world, happen]",computers
2,George M. Church,"Most people are excited about themselves. Personal genome will deliver for inexpensively something about science to which you can relate. Just like computers are becoming something to which you can relate. It should be even easier to relate to your own biology, and I hope that will be one of the ways we get broader literacy in science.","[hope, science, people]",computers
3,Howard Rheingold,"Personal computers were created by some teenagers in garages because the, the wisdom of the computer industry was that people didn't want these little toys on their desk.","[wisdom, people, want]",computers
4,Howard Rheingold,"Technologies evolve in the strangest ways. Computers were created to calculate ballistics equations, and now we use them to create amusing illusions. Creating amusing illusions is a big business if you play it right.","[business, you, create]",computers
5,Jidenna,"My father raised me to build computers, hardware. Literally, as an 8 year old, I had a soldering iron and circuit boards, and this was in neighbourhoods that wouldn't have a whole lot of money or anything. And I figured out ways to just hustle.","[money, father, year]",computers
6,Tim Berners-Lee,"The Semantic Web is not a separate Web but an extension of the current one, in which information is given well-defined meaning, better enabling computers and people to work in cooperation.","[work, people, meaning]",computers
7,Tim Berners-Lee,"We could say we want the Web to reflect a vision of the world where everything is done democratically. To do that, we get computers to talk with each other in such a way as to promote that ideal.","[vision, world, want]",computers
8,Eric Schmidt,People assume that computers will do everything that humans do. Not good. People are different from each other and they are all really different from computers.,"[good, people, good people]",computers
9,Eric Schmidt,Your car should drive itself. It's amazing to me that we let humans drive cars... It's a bug that cars were invented before computers.,"[car, amazing, me]",computers
10,Eric Schmidt,"People are good at intuition, living our lives. What are computers good at? Memory.","[good, memory, people]",computers
11,Eric Schmidt,"I've come to a view that humans will continue to do what we do well, and that computers will continue to do what they do very well, and the two will coexist, but in different spaces.","[view, will, two]",computers
12,James Gleick,"Strangely enough, the linking of computers has taken place democratically, even anarchically. Its rules and habits are emerging in the open light, rather shall behind the closed doors of security agencies or corporate operations centers.","[light, security, rules]",computers
13,Erykah Badu,"Man, I don't want to have nothing to do with computers. I don't want the government in my business.","[business, man, government]",computers
14,Jack Dangermond,I went on to Harvard and got very interested in computers and studying the earth's landscape.,"[earth, studying, landscape]",computers
15,Jack Dangermond,"GIS started on mainframe computers; we could get one map every five to 10 hours, and if we made a mistake, it could take longer. In the early '90s, when people started buying PCs, we migrated to desktop software.","[people, mistake, early]",computers
16,Scott Turow,"I'm a computer guy, and one of the things I did with the good fortune that 'Presumed Innocent' brought me was to buy one of the very first laptop computers. It weighed about eight and a half pounds, by the way.","[good, me, way]",computers
17,Bikram Choudhury,"I guarantee you, yoga will compete with computers, music, sports, automobiles, the drug industry. Yoga will take over the world!","[music, sports, world]",computers
18,Raf Simons,"Computers let people avoid people, going out to explore. It's so different to just open a website instead of looking at a Picasso in a museum in Paris.","[people, looking, website]",computers
19,Stacey D'Erasmo,"There are more clocks than ever - clocks on computers, on cell phones, on televisions, on any screen available, telling time to the digital second - but they all seem to matter less.","[time, digital, phones]",computers
20,Tom Scholz,"I detest computers. If you had a device like that 30 years ago that froze up constantly, misbehaved constantly, lost your information and screwed up when you needed it the most, it would have been laughable.","[information, lost, you]",computers
21,Steve Wozniak,What I was proud of was that I used very few parts to build a computer that could actually speak words on a screen and type words on a keyboard and run a programming language that could play games. And I did all this myself.,"[myself, language, words]",computers
22,Steve Wozniak,My whole life had been designing computers I could never build.,"[life, build, never]",computers
23,Steve Wozniak,"At our computer club, we talked about it being a revolution. Computers were going to belong to everyone, and give us power, and free us from the people who owned computers and all that stuff.","[power, people, revolution]",computers
24,Steve Wozniak,My goal wasn't to make a ton of money. It was to build good computers. I only started the company when I realized I could be an engineer forever.,"[money, good, goal]",computers
25,Adora Svitak,"I wouldn't call myself a geek, but I do sometimes teach Mommy and Daddy stuff about computers. And I do watch TV, but only informative programmes like the news and documentaries.","[myself, teach, news]",computers
