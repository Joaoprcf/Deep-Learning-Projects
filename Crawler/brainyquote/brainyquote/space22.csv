0,Stephen Covey,"Between stimulus and response, there is a space where we choose our response.","[attitude, choose, response]",space
1,Soledad O'Brien,"Our goal is to tell people about the International Space Station. I think very rarely people look up 250 miles and think, What are those guys working on, what are those men and women doing at this moment... They're living and doing regular things, but also doing incredible work as well. We really want to bring that to people.","[work, women, goal]",space
2,Christine Lagarde,"I have a theory that women are generally given space and appointed to jobs when the situation is tough. I've observed that in many instances. In times of crisis, women eventually are called upon to sort out the mess, face the difficult issues and be completely focused on restoring the situation.","[women, face, tough]",space
3,Buzz Aldrin,"As someone who flew two space capsules and twice landed in the ocean, I can attest from personal experience how much logistics work is needed to get you home.","[work, home, experience]",space
4,Bob Filner,"To all the women that I've offended, I had no intention to be offensive, to violate any physical or emotional space. I was trying to establish personal relationships, but the combination of awkwardness and hubris led to behavior that I think many found offensive.","[women, trying, behavior]",space
5,Kevin A. Ford,"I think someday, out in space, perhaps, some people might be able to grow some of their own food or hopefully on another planet.","[food, people, grow]",space
6,John Darnielle,"It's like fiction - the fact that somebody's telling you a story about people who didn't exist doesn't make the experience of the story any less real in your heart and mind. You go through heavy emotional responses to these stories, and wrestling is a similar thing - but it's happening in real space.","[experience, heart, mind]",space
7,Douglas Brinkley,"For years, I longed to hear Armstrong describe what it was like to contemplate Earth from 238,900 miles away. Former Space Center director George Abbey once told me that many NASA astronauts felt that looking at Earth was akin to a religious experience.","[experience, looking, me]",space
8,Kara Walker,"The promise of any artwork is that it can hold us - viewer and maker - in a conflicted or contestable space, without real-world injury or loss.","[loss, hold, promise]",space
9,Carlo Rubbia,"In Italy there's perhaps a little less space than in Spain, but there's certainly as much sunshine.","[sunshine, italy, spain]",space
10,Wayne Dyer,"Find joy and solace in the simple, and cultivate your utopia by feeling the Tao in every cubic inch of space.","[joy, simple, find]",space
11,Piet Mondrian,"Things are beautiful or ugly only in time and space. The new man's vision being liberated from these two factors, all is unified in one unique beauty.","[time, beauty, beautiful]",space
12,Doug Aitken,"My office has two buildings that function like the right and left sides of the brain. There's a room where everything is being edited for an upcoming project, but you can pull out of that into a tranquil space to work in a different, more solitary medium. It's an architectural unfolding of the process instead of just one chaotic structure.","[work, brain, process]",space
13,Helen Sharman,"You don't go into space just for the science. Economically, it is not worth it. I think the reason we should be in space is for the exploration; it's the human endeavour.","[science, think, reason]",space
14,Helen Sharman,"When the history books are written in a thousand years, when space travel would have become routine, the moment that humans first left Earth will be of huge importance. Star City is a central part of this story and it deserves more recognition.","[travel, history, moment]",space
15,Kate Klise,"During the holiday season, it's easy to forget that sometimes the best gift of all is simply the gift of time. I can't think of anything a writer would appreciate more than being given time and space to work.","[best, work, time]",space
16,George Lucas,"I was afraid that science-fiction buffs and everybody would say things like, 'You know, there's no sound in outer space.'","[know, afraid, you]",space
17,Lilly Singh,There is no casting director; there is no producer monitoring your upload button. Anyone that looks like anyone can upload a video. I think YouTube and the digital space does set a really good example for the rest of the industry in that sense.,"[good, digital, think]",space
18,Scott Kelly,"When I look at the clouds over the Earth, and I know how high clouds are, I get a sense we are really, really far above those clouds. I wouldn't call it scary, but I am aware I am in space.","[i am, clouds, earth]",space
19,Brit Morin,"While it's true that women are the minority in most tech companies, I don't think that inhibits entry into the tech space. My motto has always been, 'Live What You Love,' and as such, I think it's incredibly important to do work you believe in and to work for a company that has values that align with your own, be it in tech or another industry.","[love, work, women]",space
20,Richard Branson,We have teams of people working on electric cars. So you never know - you may find Virgin competing with the Tesla in the car business as we do in the space business.,"[business, car, people]",space
21,Henry Rollins,"When a young non-white male is stopped and searched at the whim of a police officer, his idea of personal space, privacy and self esteem are shattered, to say nothing of his Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment protections. The damage goes deep quickly and stays. Stop & frisk, as well as a tactic, is also an incitement.","[deep, self, privacy]",space
22,Ray Bradbury,"I'm never going to go to Mars, but I've helped inspire, thank goodness, the people who built the rockets and sent our photographic equipment off to Mars.","[inspire, people, mars]",space
23,Thelma Golden,"The privilege I've had as a curator is not just the discovery of new works... but what I've discovered about myself and what I can offer in the space of an exhibition - to talk about beauty, to talk about power, to talk about ourselves, and to talk and speak to each other.","[beauty, power, myself]",space
24,Buzz Aldrin,It's time to open the space frontier to citizen explorers.,"[time, citizen, open]",space
25,Buzz Aldrin,"Space is not just going up and coming back down again. Space is getting into orbit and being there, living there, establishing a presence, a permanence.","[living, down, being there]",space
