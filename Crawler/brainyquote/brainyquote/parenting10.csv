1,Tamsin Greig,"I have a shallow understanding of what it means to be alive, and I know certain things about parenting and being a wife and doing the school run. I know little bits, but I'm really a paddler on a beach.","[school, beach, wife]",parenting

3,Emily Oster,I think we've moved to thinking of parenting and pregnancy as something in which you should lose yourself.,"[thinking, yourself, think]",parenting
4,Emily Oster,"The basic idea that incentives can be used to motivate behavior is a powerful one. It works for employees, and it has a clear place in parenting, as anyone who has tried to potty-train a recalcitrant toddler with sticker rewards knows.","[behavior, employees]",parenting
5,Gloria Swanson,I feel sure that unborn babies pick their parents.,"[parents, feel, pick]",parenting
6,Jessica Valenti,The truth about parenting is that the reality of our lives needs to be enough.,"[truth, reality, enough]",parenting
7,Jessica Valenti,I think that the ideal of parenting can make people unhappy. It's that this lie that they're being told by society that parenting is one thing - and when parenting is something completely different - that's what makes them unhappy.,"[society, people, lie]",parenting
8,Rose Kennedy,"When you hold your baby in your arms the first time, and you think of all the things you can say and do to influence him, it's a tremendous responsibility.

10,Adam Davidson,"I'm not the first to admit that raising a child in Park Slope, Brooklyn, can bear an embarrassing resemblance to the TV show 'Portlandia.' My wife and I try to have some ironic distance from the culture of organic, chemical-free parenting, but we're often participants.","[culture, wife, child]",parenting
11,Kym Whitley,"My parenting style is probably like that of my parents, because you do how you learn. My mother was very nurturing and loving, but very stern. She was a disciplinary. My dad was also very loving.","[dad, mother, parents]",parenting
12,Mika Brzezinski,"I realize that of all people, I am no expert on parenting or marriage.","[marriage, i am, people]",parenting

16,Carl Honore,"Everywhere, people are discovering that doing things more slowly often means doing them better and enjoying them more. It means living life instead of rushing through it. You can apply this to everything from food to parenting to work.","[life, work, food]",parenting
17,Carl Honore,"To me, Slow parenting is about bringing balance into the home. Children need to strive and struggle and stretch themselves, but that does not mean childhood should be a race. Slow parents give their children plenty of time and space to explore the world on their own terms.","[time, home, children]",parenting
18,Carl Honore,Slow parents understand that childrearing should not be a cross between a competitive sport and product-development. It is not a project; it's a journey. Slow parenting is about giving kids lots of love and attention with no conditions attached.,"[love, journey, giving]",parenting

22,Tim McGraw,"I have three daughters, so I can't be as tough as I want to be. When you have kids - especially daughters - they know how to work you. They're a lot smarter than we are, that's for sure. But I'll be more tough on their boyfriends.","[work, tough, know]",parenting
23,Arlie Russell Hochschild,"In response to our fast-food culture, a 'slow food' movement appeared. Out of hurried parenthood, a move toward slow parenting could be growing. With vital government supports for state-of-the-art public child care and paid parental leave, maybe we would be ready to try slow love and marriage.","[love, marriage, food]",parenting
24,Arlie Russell Hochschild,"No work-family balance will ever fully take hold if the social conditions that might make it possible - men who are willing to share parenting and housework, communities that value work in the home as highly as work on the job, and policymakers and elected officials who are prepared to demand family-friendly reforms - remain out of reach.","[work, home, balance]",parenting
25,Jodi Benson,"I can only speak for my husband and myself, but we don't feel like we could do any of this parenting without our faith.","[faith, myself, speak]",parenting
