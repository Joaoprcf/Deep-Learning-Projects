9,Chuck Palahniuk,"My private history in terms of people in my life who are dead is very easy to discuss. I don't feel those people can be threatened or intruded upon now.

13,Henrik Fisker,"The biggest challenge is to build the team and start the company, while hiring people, raising money, building a brand which has no history, all at the same time. You're doing a lot of things that in an established company are already done.","[time, money, team]",history

17,Bill Bryson,"Open your refrigerator door, and you summon forth more light than the total amount enjoyed by most households in the 18th century. The world at night, for much of history, was a very dark place indeed.","[light, door, world]",history
