0,Sarah Fielding,The loss of liberty which must attend being a wife was of all things the most horrible to my imagination.,"[wife, loss, liberty]",imagination
1,Laura Hillenbrand,"I'm looking for a way out of here. I can't have it physically, so I'm going to have it intellectually. It was a beautiful thing to ride Seabiscuit in my imagination. And it's just fantastic to be there alongside Louie as he's breaking the NCAA mile record. People at these vigorous moments in their lives - it's my way of living vicariously.","[beautiful, people, looking]",imagination
2,David E. Kelley,Some of my high school teachers did remind me that I had an excellent imagination when it came to making up excuses.,"[teacher, school, excuses]",imagination
3,Terry Pratchett,"I've always felt that what I have going for me is not my imagination, because everyone has an imagination. What I have is a relentlessly controlled imagination. What looks like wild invention is actually quite carefully calculated.","[me, everyone, wild]",imagination
4,Carol Ann Duffy,"The moment of inspiration can come from memory, or language, or the imagination, or experience - anything that makes an impression forcibly enough for language to form.","[experience, memory, language]",imagination
5,Javier Bardem,I was raised not to be afraid to show emotion or imagination.,"[afraid, emotion, show]",imagination
6,John le Carre,"Novelists are not equipped to make a movie, in my opinion. They make their own movie when they write: they're casting, they're dressing the scene, they're working out where the energy of the scene is coming from and they're also relying tremendously on the creative imagination of the reader.","[creative, energy, opinion]",imagination
7,J. G. Ballard,I don't think it's possible to touch people's imagination today by aesthetic means.,"[today, people, think]",imagination
8,Joshua Bell,"For some reason I can't explain, artist and musicians tend to look younger than our age. Being in music, you need this youthful sense of discovery and wonder for what you're doing and keep your imagination open. That's a youthful way of looking at life and I think that reflects in how you age.","[life, music, age]",imagination
9,Jonathan Sacks,"The Jewish festival of freedom is the oldest continuously observed religious ritual in the world. Across the centuries, Passover has never lost its power to inspire the imagination of successive generations of Jews with its annually re-enacted drama of slavery and liberation.","[freedom, power, slavery]",imagination
10,Joel C. Rosenberg,"Now, I'm a failed political consultant. But sometimes fiction has a way of capturing people's imagination in a way that non-fiction doesn't. Conservatives typically haven't written much fiction - specifically political thrillers - over the years to educate, inspire and mobilize people on issues of great import, but we ought to.","[great, political, inspire]",imagination
11,Henning Mankell,"I still have a photo on my wall of the greatest idol I will ever have in my life, and it's myself at eight. Because that's when the forces of imagination have the same value as the real world, when they're an instrument of survival: when my mother disappeared, and I imagined a mother. That was me at my best.","[life, best, myself]",imagination
12,Max Irons,"I mean, it's fine when you're a kid and someone runs into the playground and goes, 'I've got this great game of pretend,' and you play... As an actor, getting to play, getting to use your imagination and be childish - it is weird but it's wonderful.","[great, game, someone]",imagination
13,Paloma Faith,Sometimes when you've got too much money you lose your imagination.,"[money, you, sometimes]",imagination
14,Hilary Mantel,"Imagination only comes when you privilege the subconscious, when you make delay and procrastination work for you.","[work, procrastination, you]",imagination
15,Adam Gopnik,"The World Series is played in my doubtless too-nostalgic imagination in some kind of autumn afternoon light, and seeing it exclusively in the bitter chill of midnight breaks the spell of even the best of games.","[best, light, autumn]",imagination
16,Lisi Harrison,I was a terrible athlete and a pretty bad student. I couldn't focus. My imagination was always racing.,"[focus, athlete, student]",imagination
17,Brian Jacques,"I wanted to write something visual that I could read to the children. This was when I created the idea of Redwall Abbey in my imagination. As I wrote, the idea grew, and the manuscript along with it.","[children, something, visual]",imagination
18,Nolan North,"I'm an actor. Whether I'm on stage, in front of a camera or a microphone, what I do is the same - although with videogames it requires a lot of imagination.","[camera, actor, same]",imagination
19,Stephen Lang,"On some level, acting is the art of pretend, and you have to have a highly cultivated sense of imagination. You have to be able to see things that aren't there, no matter what aspect of acting, whether it's green screen, whether it's on stage, whether it's anything else, whether you're working on the radio.","[art, green, acting]",imagination
20,Steven Wright,"People may think I'm trying something new by telling stories, but they're just jokes connected to give the illusion of stories. But really, I just continue using my imagination and creating. That's what I do.","[people, trying, think]",imagination
21,Ishmael Beah,"I grew up in Sierra Leone, in a small village where as a boy my imagination was sparked by the oral tradition of storytelling. At a very young age I learned the importance of telling stories - I saw that stories are the most potent way of seeing anything we encounter in our lives, and how we can deal with living.","[age, small, living]",imagination
22,Ramana Maharshi,"For those who have obtained unobstructed knowledge of Self, the world is seen merely as a bondage causing imagination.","[knowledge, self, world]",imagination
23,John Cassavetes,"The idea of love as a mysterious, undiscovered world has come to have no place in our innermost imagination.","[love, world, place]",imagination
24,George William Russell,We have the universe to roam in in imagination. It is our virtue to be infinitely varied. The worst tyranny is uniformity.,"[universe, tyranny, worst]",imagination
25,John Millington Synge,"Of the things which nourish the imagination, humour is one of the most needful, and it is dangerous to limit or destroy it.","[limit, dangerous, destroy]",imagination
