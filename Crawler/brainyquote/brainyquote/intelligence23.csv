8,Sebastian Thrun,"You could claim that moving from pixelated perception, where the robot looks at sensor data, to understanding and predicting the environment is a Holy Grail of artificial intelligence.","[moving, environment]",intelligence

10,Ellen DeGeneres,"My dad is still Christian Scientist. My mom's not, and I'm not.
