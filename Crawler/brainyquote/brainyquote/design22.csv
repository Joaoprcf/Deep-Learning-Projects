0,Tom Ford,The dynamics of film directing and fashion design - in the ways that I've done it - were not dissimilar.,"[fashion, done, film]",design
1,Tom Ford,"As a designer, design director or any creative person, you have to hire great people, support them and make them feel comfortable so they can contribute and give you their best.","[best, great, support]",design
2,Tom Ford,"I love to design. I am a commercial fashion designer. I always design jackets with two sleeves. I don't design jackets with three sleeves, or the layers and layers come off like little dolls from Russia. Fashion for me is a creative endeavor, but it is not art for me.","[love, art, i am]",design
3,Tom Ford,"There are many designers who have much greater talent as a designer than I do, but they may not have my drive, they may not work as hard, they may not have the focus, the desire... You have to have a talent because, at the end of the day, if the pants you design don't make someone's butt look great, they're not going to buy them.","[work, great, end]",design
4,Ben Stein,"For me, I've always believed that there was a God. I've always believed that God created the heavens and earth - so, for me it's not a huge leap from there to intelligent design.","[god, me, earth]",design
5,Diane von Furstenberg,I design for the woman who loves being a woman.,"[woman, being, who]",design
6,Diane von Furstenberg,"I never like to think that I design for a particular person. I design for the woman I wanted to be, the woman I used to be, and - to some degree - the woman I'm still a little piece of.","[woman, think, person]",design
7,Diane von Furstenberg,"There's design, and there's art. Good design is total harmony. There's no better designer than nature - if you look at a branch or a leaf, it's perfect. It's all function. Art is different. It's about emotion. It's about suffering and beauty - but mostly suffering!","[nature, beauty, art]",design
8,Diane von Furstenberg,A challenging economy is always good for design. It unites necessity and functionality. You are forced to be creative with poor materials.,"[good, creative, poor]",design
9,Diane von Furstenberg,The way I design generally is very much travel-oriented because that is my life. That's why I make clothes that are so light and so easy to pack and a little bit seasonless.,"[life, light, easy]",design
10,Diane von Furstenberg,"My favorite days are the ones where I deal only with my own team, design, marketing, working on the next accessories collection.","[team, marketing, working]",design
11,Martin Rees,"Space doesn't offer an escape from Earth's problems. And even with nuclear fuel, the transit time to nearby stars exceeds a human lifetime. Interstellar travel is therefore, in my view, an enterprise for post-humans, evolved from our species not via natural selection, but by design.","[travel, time, stars]",design
12,Justin Timberlake,"Technology's related to everything. Technology is making the world more accessible, so yeah, as generations go by, they'll become more and more married to each other, for sure. I think they go hand in hand - fashion inspires design, and technology inspires design as well.","[technology, world, fashion]",design
13,Erma Bombeck,Sometimes I can't figure designers out. It's as if they flunked human anatomy.,"[sometimes, human, anatomy]",design
14,Jonathan Ive,All I've ever wanted to do is design and make; it's what I love doing.,"[love, doing, ever]",design
15,Jonathan Ive,"When something's made in the smallest volume - as a one-off couture piece - or in large quantities, deep care is critical to determine authentic, successful design and, ultimately, manufacture.","[deep, successful, care]",design
16,Jonathan Ive,We struggle with the right words to describe the design process at Apple. But it is very much about designing and prototyping and making.,"[struggle, words, process]",design
17,Jonathan Ive,"Deep in the culture of Apple is this sense and understanding of design, developing, and making. Form and the material and process - they are beautifully intertwined - completely connected.","[culture, deep, process]",design
18,Jonathan Ive,My focus is incredibly narrow. I can't talk with any authority other than design and development of product.,"[focus, development]",design
19,Jonathan Ive,"One of the things that is particularly precious about working at Apple is that many of us on the design team have worked together for 15-plus years, and there's a wonderful thing about learning as a group. A fundamental part of that is making mistakes together.","[learning, together, team]",design
20,Jonathan Ive,"I find that when I write, I need things to be quiet, but when I design, I can't bear it if it's quiet.","[find, quiet, bear]",design
21,Jonathan Ive,"That's just tragic, that you can spend four years of your life studying the design of three dimensional objects and not make one.","[life, studying, you]",design
22,Sean Bean,"I love creating things, especially out of metal. There's something truly satisfying about shaping a piece of metal and seeing the impurities peeling away as you weld it into your chosen design.","[love, metal, you]",design
23,Flume,I'd like to do some crazy art installations and design some weird synthesizers and work with other people and make some fun stuff for a bit. Maybe tap into virtual reality stuff or maybe write another record... We'll see.,"[work, art, fun]",design
24,Kendall Jenner,I definitely want to design clothes at one point.,"[want, clothes, point]",design
25,Kendall Jenner,I weirdly love interior design and real estate and all of that. I really do. I get chills from it.,"[love, real estate, interior]",design
