7,Billy Collins,"The poem is not, as someone put it, deflective of entry. But the real question is, 'What happens to the reader once he or she gets inside the poem?'

11,Mandy Moore,"I travel the world visiting global health programs as an ambassador for the global health organization, PSI, and sometimes the disconnect I see is truly striking: people can get cold Coca Cola, but far too infrequently malaria drugs; most own mobile phones, but don't have equal access to pre-natal care.","[health, world, people]",travel
12,John Niven,"My family went to Toronto to visit relatives when I was 13 or 14. It was the first time we had ever been abroad.

19,Debi Mazar,"I like to watch Bourdain and Andrew Zimmern, because I like them when they travel. I like Ina Garten, 'The Barefoot Contessa.' Giada is really nice, but I get a little bit bored with just staying in the kitchen.","[nice, kitchen, bored]",travel
