0,Warren Ellis,"Here's the thing about Apple technology: once you own a piece, you want to use it.","[want, you, apple]",technology
1,Theophilus London,I like connecting with people through technology.,"[people, like, through]",technology
2,Virginia Postrel,"Grassroots techies - the mostly unknown people who write code and start companies that don't make the headlines - hate, loathe, and despise Microsoft. At technology conferences, it is the devil, or the guaranteed laugh line. Its products are mocked, its business practices booed.","[business, hate, people]",technology
3,Mitchel Resnick,"I started my career as a journalist, writing about science and technology for 'Business Week' magazine. Then I decided to make a career shift. I went to graduate school in computer science, and I began developing educational technologies - in particular, technologies to engage children in creative learning experiences.","[learning, business, science]",technology
4,Dimitar Sasselov,"It's feasible that we'll meet other sentient life forms and conduct commerce with them. We don't now have the technology to physically travel outside our solar system for such an exchange to take place, but we are like Columbus centuries ago, learning fast how to get somewhere few think possible.","[life, travel, learning]",technology
5,Michael Schultz,"I see film as a real opportunity to examine the human condition. No matter where the technology goes in the future, the basics don't change. Storytelling is a primitive tribal function. The elders sat around the fires and told these stories as a way to pass on the 'dos' and the 'don'ts.' That will never change.","[change, future, opportunity]",technology
6,Soledad O'Brien,"I don't think journalism changes. It's about digging into stories and telling them well. The basic tenets of great reporting stay the same while things around it change. Technology has made reporting easier, but it has also caused job loss. Social media has increased discussion around topics, but it has its own challenges at times.","[change, social media, great]",technology
7,Magda Apanowicz,"I like that in 'Caprica' the virtual world is a new thing. The parents didn't have that growing up. And it's the same thing about the Internet and all the current technology. It didn't exist like it does now for our parents' generation. Kids aren't relating to their parents anymore, and I just find that so honest.","[parents, generation, world]",technology
8,Thomas P.M. Barnett,"During the cold war, it was easy for the Pentagon to justify its budget, as the Soviets essentially sized our forces for us. We simply counted up their stuff and either bought more of the same or upgraded our technology.","[war, easy, budget]",technology
9,Marco Brambilla,"Thematically, most of my work deals with transition, our culture's constant acceleration, and emotional connection and disconnection through technology.","[work, culture, transition]",technology
10,Alex Berenson,"Downhill track sports like luge are technology battles, as exciting as a NASCAR qualifying day.","[sports, day, battles]",technology
11,Alex Berenson,"Technology investment drove growth in the 1990s, both directly and by fueling a rising stock market that led to increased consumer spending.","[growth, stock market]",technology
12,Anthony Foxx,A lot of people in the technology space love the idea of a solving a problem.,"[love, people, problem]",technology
13,Nancy Gibbs,"The millennials were raised in a cocoon, their anxious parents afraid to let them go out in the park to play. So should we be surprised that they learned to leverage technology to build community, tweeting and texting and friending while their elders were still dialing long-distance?","[community, parents, afraid]",technology
14,Becki Newton,"My husband is in charge of all phone, email and texting duties at home. He even has to turn on the TV and air conditioning because I'm so hopeless with technology.","[home, husband, texting]",technology
15,Tim O'Reilly,"We want to show how technology can be applied to fix our problems. We need to celebrate not just success but to celebrate people who make a difference. It starts with people who do things for love, with no expectation of return. Some of that turns into enormous financial success, and then some of it goes back into doing it for love.","[love, success, celebrate]",technology
16,Tim O'Reilly,"I have to say there are a lot of me-too products and companies. Yet another social network, of the 15th flavor - that's common in every new technology revolution. There are imitators who have marginal improvements.","[revolution, new, say]",technology
17,Raymond E. Feist,"Science fiction is fantasy about issues of science. Science fiction is a subset of fantasy. Fantasy predated it by several millennia. The '30s to the '50s were the golden age of science fiction - this was because, to a large degree, it was at this point that technology and science had exposed its potential without revealing the limitations.","[science, age, potential]",technology
18,Andie MacDowell,"Because of technology today, we expect kids to stay in touch with us too much. I think that's unnatural. We really do have to give kids their freedom and allow them to go off and become adults.","[freedom, today, think]",technology
19,Whitfield Diffie,The most important impact of technology on communications security is that it draws better and better traffic into vulnerable channels.,"[security, impact, important]",technology
20,Chuck Schumer,"The bottom line is there are lots of problems that were not created by government. The biggest one is loss of middle class incomes, loss of good-paying jobs which was created by technology and globalization. Above all, when you can move a job to China or India, it reduces wages.","[government, job, loss]",technology
21,Jeff Dunham,"I'm guilty of being fascinated by gadgets and toys and technology, but any penny that I spend, I try to make it be a part of what I do for a living. Because then you are forwarding. You are forwarding that art, forwarding that career ahead.","[art, living, career]",technology
22,Bill Laswell,"Engineering producers who don't play and have technology as a background may be the reason why there's a lot of cold non-musical music, for lack of a better description.","[music, engineering, better]",technology
23,Ridley Scott,Technology continues to bring us wondrous advances in filmmaking to improve how we view movies.,"[filmmaking, movies, improve]",technology
24,Ridley Scott,"Technology will need to make many more huge leaps before one can ever view films with the level of picture and sound quality many film lovers demand without having to slide a disc into a player, especially with the technical requirements of today's 3D movies.","[today, quality, movies]",technology
25,Pico Iyer,"'Globalization' has become the great tag phrase, but when we talk about it, it's nearly always in terms of the global marketplace or communications technology - either data or goods that are whizzing around. We forget that people are whizzing around more and more. On them, it takes a toll.","[great, globalization, people]",technology
