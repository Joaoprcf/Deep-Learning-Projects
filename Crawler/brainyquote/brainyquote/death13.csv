How is it any different when you are under attack by your own mind?","[life, mind, reason]",death
1,Sachin Tendulkar,"If efforts to do social work are couched in selfish motives, then they will die a premature death. Why would my efforts get politicised? I have values I inherited from my father.

18,Yamamoto Tsunetomo,"Death seems to be a long way off. Is this not shallow thinking? It is worthless and is only a joke within a dream. It will not do to think in such a way and be negligent.
