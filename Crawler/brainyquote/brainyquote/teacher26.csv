0,Danica McKellar,"In high school, a teacher once suggested that I be a math major in college. I thought, 'Me? You've got to be joking!'

1,Anton du Beke,"One day, I just wandered into a dance class full of girls, and that was it. I thought, 'Hang on! I'll have a bit of this.' I went back a week later and got dragged up by the teacher. It wasn't a massive calling.","[day, dance, week]",teacher
2,Anton du Beke,"My old dance teacher, Jimmy Wilde, a former European ballroom dancing champion, was so sophisticated.","[dance, champion, dancing]",teacher
3,Herbert Hoover,"There is no employing class, no working class, no farming class. You may pigeonhole a man or woman as a farmer or a worker or a professional man or an employer or even a banker. But the son of the farmer will be a doctor or a worker or even a banker, and his daughter a teacher. The son of a worker will be an employer - or maybe president.","[daughter, woman, man]",teacher

5,Imelda May,"At school, I'd refuse to take part in biology lessons when animals were being dissected. One time, the teacher announced that we would be gassing worms.

7,Will Ferrell,"I was never a class clown or anything like that, but I do remember being in the first grade and my teacher, Mr. Chad, told the class one day that we were going to do some exercises. He meant math exercises, but I stood up and started doing jumping jacks. To this day, I don't know what possessed me to do that, but all my friends cracked up.","[day, friends, me]",teacher
8,Ben Affleck,"I grew up in a house with a mother who was a teacher and a Freedom Rider - very left-wing Democrats living in a heterogeneous working-class neighborhood.

10,Juliette Binoche,"I was used to theatre classes. I studied with my mother; she was a theatre teacher and directed, too, so it was very family-like. Then I studied with a great teacher in Paris, and she was wonderful; she pushed me, but she was a warm soul.","[great, mother, soul]",teacher
11,Flea,"About 13-14 years ago, I went back to my alma mater, Fairfax High School, and ran into the music teacher. She invited me to come speak to the kids about the viability of a music career.

14,Tony Dungy,"You never know what's going to happen. My mother was an English teacher. If someone had told her that I was going to write a book, she would never have believed that. So you can never say never.","[mother, book, know]",teacher
15,Tony Dungy,"My dad, who was a teacher, used to tell me that a teacher's goal should be for every one of their students to get an A. If that's your goal every day - to make every student or player learn - then it doesn't matter if you won last year or didn't win. When next year's team shows up, I try to help every player become as good as they can be.","[good, dad, goal]",teacher
16,Robert Duvall,"I've always remembered something Sanford Meisner, my acting teacher, told us. When you create a character, it's like making a chair, except instead of making someting out of wood, you make it out of yourself. That's the actor's craft - using yourself to create a character.","[character, yourself, wood]",teacher
17,Eli Broad,School district policies and practices have not kept pace with student and teacher needs.,"[school, student, pace]",teacher
18,Ving Rhames,"Quite honestly I never had a desire to be an actor. I tell people, I did not choose acting; acting chose me. I never grew up wanting to be an actor. I wanted to play football. In about 9th grade an English teacher told me I had a talent to act. He said I should audition for a performing arts high school so I did on a whim. I got accepted.","[school, football, people]",teacher

21,Nathan Fillion,"I kind of fell backwards into acting. I was studying to be a high school teacher. I look now and I understand completely, or actually barely, how much work it is to be a teacher. It's an incredible amount of work.","[work, school, studying]",teacher
22,Nathan Fillion,"I was attending the University of Alberta. I was going to be a high school teacher, like my parents. I failed - no, I didn't fail a class, I just barely passed. I really didn't try. It was Canadian history, through the plays of the time. My God, those were boring plays.","[time, history, god]",teacher
23,Sarah Jessica Parker,"My job requires me to put on a little dress and run around the streets of New York in heels. But I also had the financial means to hire a yoga teacher to come to my house while my sitter watched the newborn. For 95 percent of the world, that's not realistic.","[job, world, me]",teacher
24,F. Sionil Jose,"I have always admired teachers because teaching, like the priesthood, medicine and writing, is a vocation. You don't become a teacher because you want wealth. It is the same with writing.","[writing, wealth, medicine]",teacher
