0,Nancy Pelosi,"We're sad about some of the losses of members of great seniority and distinction in the Congress, and some very new members, who will no longer be serving with us.","[great, new, will]",sad
1,Robin Quivers,It's sad that women characters have lost so much ground in popular movies. Didn't 'Thelma and Louise' prove that women want to see women doing things on film? Thelma and Louise were in a classic car; they were being chased by cops; they shot up a truck - and women loved it.,"[women, car, lost]",sad
2,Cheryl Ladd,"I'm terribly sad about Farrah's passing. She was incredibly brave, and God will be welcoming her with open arms.","[god, brave, she]",sad
3,Joe Elliott,"If you don't physically age gracefully, it's a bit sad. I think Steven Tyler can get away anything, because he still looks like he did in '73. Especially from row Z backwards in an arena. As long as the Stones keep their hair and don't get fat they'll get away with the wrinkles.","[age, hair, fat]",sad
4,Bryan Adams,"I feel quite sad for the young musicians coming up because they may never get to pay their rent properly. It doesn't matter what the genre; nowadays, it's so much harder than it ever was.","[musicians, young, matter]",sad
5,Dan Savage,"My dad was a homicide cop in the gay neighborhood in the city when gay neighborhoods were desperate, depressing, sad places run by the mob. The only gay people he'd met when I came out to him were corpses.","[dad, gay, people]",sad
6,Roger Milla,"I only really watch sport. That's where you see real joy. I don't like watching much else on TV, because it's generally either twisted or sad.","[joy, see, you]",sad
7,Sylvia Browne,"It's so sad: anything that has to do with God, people want to dispel.","[god, people, want]",sad
8,Jamie Foxx,Nobody wants to hear R&B. It's sad. If you want to be on the radio you got to stay young.,"[want, young, you]",sad
9,Melissa Leo,"I mean, the unfair treatment of women and black people and Indians and other groups, that's real. Mistreatment of other people because 'I'm better than you are' is such a sad part of the world.","[women, black, world]",sad
10,Mark Boal,"Film-makers are always going to be interested in making movies that plug into society around them. That's what a vibrant, artistically alert community should be doing. After all, it would be sad if we only made films about alien robots.","[community, society, doing]",sad
11,Josh Hopkins,"I probably have the worst wardrobe. It's the most ill-fitting with the worst patterns and colors and the most nipple rubbage. There's bad chafing, and it's always tight in all the wrong places. What's sad is that I'm kinda getting used to it.","[colors, bad, worst]",sad
12,Alice Englert,"What makes me sad about school is that the people who are unhappy are unhappy because they don't believe it will change. And I just want to say: 'It does! High school ends and it's over.' I will tell anyone that it's OK to be unhappy at school, make lots of mistakes and then it will be over.","[change, school, mistakes]",sad
13,Amanda Hocking,"I was always depressed growing up. There wasn't a reason for it, I just was. I was sad and morose. I cried a lot, I wrote a lot, and I read a lot; and that was how I dealt with it.","[growing up, reason, growing]",sad
14,Glen Hansard,"And for some reason, when I'm sad, I do listen to Leonard Cohen, I do listen to Joni Mitchell. I do find myself going to the music that's actually reflecting my mood, as opposed to sticking on Motown, which might actually bring my mood up.","[music, myself, find]",sad
15,Dierks Bentley,"I'm part of the party, getting the crowd fired up, singing songs, pouring drinks, whatever it takes to get them to have a good time. When I walk into the meet-and-greet, someone's always going to have a story, a sad story or a happy story.","[time, good, happy]",sad
16,Dierks Bentley,I try to make an album that reflects what I love about country music. It's not just all about happy parties all the time. There are some sad songs.,"[love, music, time]",sad
17,Jonathan Winters,My mother and father were very strange people. They tried to be funny which is always very sad to me.,"[funny, father, mother]",sad
18,Mohsin Hamid,"Like many of my friends in the Pakistani diaspora - and many of my friends in Pakistan itself, for that matter - I have sometimes looked at the country of my birth and wondered whether its future will be one of steady and sad decline.","[future, friends, matter]",sad
19,Karen Gillan,"Being in 'Doctor Who' has been so amazing. I don't think I will ever have a job quite so fun ever again. I feel sad because I am going to leave, but with any story, it has to come to an end.","[end, i am, amazing]",sad
20,Mattie Stepanek,"Poetry is a beautiful way of expressing feelings - happy, sad, angry, caring. It's also a way that we share with other people, to help them with those feelings.","[happy, poetry, beautiful]",sad
21,Bruce Forsyth,"It's sad when you see most of your friends in the business gone, like Tommy Cooper, Frankie Howard, Eric Morecambe, Roy Castle, Les Dawson. They were very dear to me. You no longer have the chance to bump into them at a celebrity do.","[business, friends, me]",sad
22,Austin Nichols,It's really sad down there. Everyone's sitting around asking to help and BP won't let anybody do anything. People are coming down to help. People want to help.,"[help, people, want]",sad
23,Robbie Jones,'Lost' was my favorite show! I'm really sad that it's gone.,"[lost, favorite, show]",sad
24,June Diane Raphael,"I took a couple of classes in clowning, but that was more like Lucille Ball kind of slapstick, not Ringling Brothers. But we had to do things silently, and the teacher would do this running commentary. 'Does this make Clown sad? Oh, Clown doesn't like that, does Clown?' Always 'Clown.' Never a name.","[teacher, name, kind]",sad
25,Romola Garai,It's a sad fact that a lot of those countries who haven't been involved in the war in Iraq have taken far more responsibility for rehoming people displaced by the war than Britain has done.,"[war, responsibility, people]",sad
