0,Chuck Close,"Neurologically, I'm a quadriplegic, so virtually everything about my work has been driven by my learning disabilities, which are quite severe, and my lack of facial recognition, which I'm sure is what drove me to paint portraits in the first place.","[work, me, recognition]",learning

3,Twyla Tharp,"When I started thinking seriously about learning the rules of narrative, I thought, 'You've learned the rules of dancing from the ballet; what's the matter with learning the laws of theater from the people who know how to do it?'","[thinking, people, thought]",learning
4,Rusty Schweickart,"Asteroids are deep-space bodies orbiting the Sun, not the Earth, and traveling to one would mean sending humans into solar orbit for the very first time. Facing those challenges of radiation, navigation and life support on a months-long trip millions of miles from home would be a perfect learning journey before a Mars trip.","[life, time, home]",learning

7,Eric Kandel,"You could double the number of synaptic connections in a very simple neurocircuit as a result of experience and learning.

8,Eric Kandel,I like problems at the borders of disciplines. One of the reasons that neurobiology of learning and memory appeal to me so much was that I liked the idea of bringing biology and psychology together.,"[together, memory, me]",learning

12,Mitchel Resnick,"As I see it, whoever's doing the inventing is also doing most of the learning - and probably having most of the fun.","[fun, doing, see]",learning
13,Dimitar Sasselov,"It's feasible that we'll meet other sentient life forms and conduct commerce with them.

15,Sasha Roiz,"With every episodic, there's a learning curve where writers try to find the voice of the characters by way of the actors. Many details are found along the way. On 'Caprica,' although the franchise already existed, we were creating an entirely new world full of new characters.","[world, voice, details]",learning
16,Thomas Friedman,"When I think back on my favorite teachers, I don't remember anymore much of what they taught me, but I sure remember being excited about learning it.

17,Daniela Ruah,That's the beauty of the acting world. You can play so many different characters who know and do so many things that you have no idea about as yourself. So I'm a big fan of workshops and classes and learning new things because you can always apply it. It's your little supply bag of creativity. Keep filling it up.,"[beauty, creativity, yourself]",learning
18,Daniella Alonso,"I actually take karate and tae-kwon-do. And so I love sparring and grappling and all that physical stuff. I studied a hybrid form of grappling, sparring, and self defense; it's more of a 'get yourself in shape,' and if you want to take it to the next level, so you're really learning valuable skills with self defense, and I really enjoy it.","[love, self, yourself]",learning
19,Drew Houston,"Where you live matters. Whatever you're doing, there's usually only one place where the top people go. You should go there. Don't settle for anywhere else. Meeting my heroes and learning from them gave me a huge advantage. Your heroes are part of your circle, too - follow them. If the real action is happening somewhere else, move.","[people, me, action]",learning

25,Tony Buzan,"Like our physical bodies, our memory becomes out of shape. As children, we are constantly learning new experiences, but by the time we reach our 20s, we start to lead a more sedentary life both mentally and physically. Our lives become routine, and we stop challenging our brains, and our memory starts to suffer.","[life, time, children]",learning
