0,Margaret Atwood,"I'm a strict, strict agnostic. It's very different from a casual, 'I don't know.' It's that you cannot present as knowledge something that is not knowledge. You can present it as faith, you can present it as belief, but you can't present it as fact.","[knowledge, belief, know]",faith
1,Joel Osteen,"Sometimes you need faith and victory spoken over your life. Words have created power. When you receive them into your spirit, they can ignite seeds of increase on the inside.","[life, power, victory]",faith
2,James Dobson,"Unfortunately, many young believers - and some older ones, too - do not know that there will be times in every person's life when circumstances don't add up - when God doesn't appear to make sense. This aspect of the Christian faith is not well advertised.","[life, god, christian]",faith
3,Julia Cameron,"I believe that the 'dark night of the soul' is a common spiritual experience. I believe, too, that the answer is continued seeking and perseverance. It helps to know that others have endured a loss of faith.","[experience, perseverance]",faith
4,Julia Cameron,"Faith is almost the bottom line of creativity; it requires a leap of faith any time we undertake a creative endeavor, whether this is going to the easel, or the page, or onto the stage - or for that matter, in a homelier way, picking out the right fabric for the kitchen curtains, which is also a creative act.","[time, creativity, creative]",faith
5,John Boyle O'Reilly,"Women are at once the guardians and the well-spring of the world's faith, morality, and tenderness; and if ever they are degraded to a commonplace level with men, this fine essential quality will be impaired, and their weakness will have to beg and follow where now it guides and controls.","[women, quality, men]",faith
6,Chiang Kai-shek,We must teach our people the greatness of China's historical culture. In our educational program we must stress Chinese history and geography so that all may know and appreciate China's civilization of five thousand years and the far-flung boundaries of our ancient race. This will engender a greater faith in our own future.,"[future, history, culture]",faith
7,Soledad O'Brien,"I've taken the leap of faith to stop punching the company time clock and start working for myself. I'm now the CEO of Starfish Media Group, my production company, in New York City.","[time, myself, media]",faith
8,Katie Ledecky,My faith has always been important to me. It defines who I am.,"[i am, me, important]",faith
9,Roma Downey,I think that 'Little Angels' provides the gateway into that conversation about faith and about the Lord and about God's love for us. Remembering that the angels are just the messengers and the message is the message of love.,"[love, god, angels]",faith
10,Pierce Brosnan,"It always helps to have a bit of prayer in your back pocket. At the end of the day, you have to have something, and for me, that is God, Jesus, my Catholic upbringing, my faith.","[god, end, prayer]",faith
11,Cory Booker,"I'm a person that's grounded in faith and believe that my core values, motivation, inspiration, draw from a conception of the world in that way.","[believe, motivation, world]",faith
12,Cory Booker,"My simple point is that I judge a person's faith by how they live their life, not by the tenets of their religion. I've watched the holiest of people walk past somebody in need or treat their staff mean. To me, the beauty of faith is only seen when people live it consistently or struggle to do so.","[life, beauty, religion]",faith
13,Ted Cruz,Far too many candidates wear their faith on their sleeve.,"[many, far, wear]",faith
14,Joyce Kilmer,"I believed in the Catholic position, the Catholic view of ethics and aesthetics, for a long time. But I wanted something not intellectual, some conviction not mental - in fact I wanted faith.","[time, ethics, intellectual]",faith
15,Adam Hamilton,"Those who are believers in God find strength from their faith in the face of suffering. They are compelled to give sacrificially to help those in need. And they have the hope that comes from knowing that, with God by their side, the tragedy they are facing is never the final word.","[hope, strength, god]",faith
16,Victoria Osteen,"Reality TV is to popular because it allows so many people to sit on the sidelines and just watch somebody else's life. God is saying, 'Don't sit on the sidelines of life. I have put so much in you, but you have got to be strong and very courageous. You have got to step out in faith.'","[life, god, strong]",faith
17,Virginia Euwer Wolff,The teenage years are the years to examine faith - the need to be independent and the need to be anchored. Who made all this? And what do I have to do with it?,"[need, independent, years]",faith
18,Jeb Bush,"My record as a pro-life governor is not in dispute. I am completely pro-life, and I believe that we should have a culture of life. It's informed by my faith from beginning to end. And this not just as it related to unborn babies - I did it at the end of life issues as well. This is something that goes way beyond politics.","[life, culture, politics]",faith
19,Charles Spurgeon,"In prayer, we stand where angels bow with veiled faces. There, even there, the cherubim and seraphim adore before that selfsame throne to which our prayers ascend. And shall we come there with stunted requests and narrow, contracted faith?","[prayer, stand, angels]",faith
20,Alice McDermott,"I think 'Charming Billy' ultimately is a novel about faith and what we believe in and, above all, what we choose to believe in.","[believe, choose, think]",faith
21,Joe Carnahan,"There's a duality of a guy calling on God: 'Where are you when I need you?' and then, at the same time, 'God helps those who help themselves.' I think that contradiction does exist in all of us, those of faith and those who profess to have no faith.","[time, god, help]",faith
22,Nicholas Kristof,Beware of generalizations about any faith because they sometimes amount to the religious equivalent of racial profiling. Hinduism contained both Gandhi and the fanatic who assassinated him.,"[racial, sometimes, him]",faith
23,Leila Aboulela,"My faith was started off by my grandmother and mother, and so I always saw it as a very private, personal thing.","[mother, grandmother]",faith

25,Natalie Cole,"I'm a born-again Christian. I was raised Episcopalian - I've always been of a Christian faith, but I became much more active in it when I married my first husband, Marvin. I changed from Episcopalian to Baptist.","[husband, christian, always]",faith
