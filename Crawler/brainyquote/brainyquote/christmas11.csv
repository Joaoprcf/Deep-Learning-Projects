1,Rory MacLean,"To me, it remains incomprehensible that a people who can design the Porsche 911 and sleek, white ice trains, who created the Bauhaus and speak at least three languages at birth, want to own twee Christmas figurines painted in gaudy colours, dress up in Bavarian lederhosen, and eat Haribo gummy bears.","[design, people, me]",christmas
2,Clint Black,I intend to keep writing Christmas songs. There's still a lot more about Christmas that can be captured and feel like old-time Christmas. A lot of the traditions haven't been explained in song.,"[writing, song, traditions]",christmas
3,Joel Hodgson,South Park started as a little video Christmas card.,"[video, little, south park]",christmas

5,Josie Bissett,"I'd have to say, for me, as a child, my favorite memories were always centered around Christmas time.

7,Jonathan Taylor Thomas,"I wouldn't recommend young kids see 'Speedway Junkie.' It's definitely an age-appropriate movie - dark and realistic and edgy. If young kids want to see me, go see the Christmas movie.","[dark, me, want]",christmas
8,Ashley Tisdale,"I love Christmas, not just because of the presents but because of all the decorations and lights and the warmth of the season.","[love, season, lights]",christmas
9,John C. Reilly,I am one of those people who is not very patient in the makeup chair. I have been offered movies like 'Planet of the Apes' and stuff like 'The Grinch Who Stole Christmas' and I turned them down.,"[i am, makeup, people]",christmas
10,Ja Rule,"I stopped going to Kingdom Hall, the church, when I was 11 years old, so I was very young. They don't celebrate birthdays, you get no Christmas, so it's a very difficult religion for children to get into. And they do a lot of finger-pointing among the Jehovah's Witnesses.","[children, religion]",christmas
11,Gil Marks,"Throughout history, Hanukkah was a relatively minor festival, but it's become very popular in America due to its proximity to Christmas.","[history, america, festival]",christmas

18,George Weah,"My father died when I was young and I was raised by my grandmother, Emma Klonjlaleh Brown. We could afford to eat chicken just once a year, on Christmas.","[father, year, young]",christmas
19,Meghan O'Rourke,"My mother died of metastatic colorectal cancer shortly before three P.M. on Christmas Day of 2008. I don't know the exact time of her death, because none of us thought to look at a clock for a while after she stopped breathing.","[time, death, mother]",christmas
20,Sloane Crosley,"Brits and Americans have hundreds of different phrases for the same thing. Luckily, it's usually a source of amusement rather than frustration. A flashlight by any other name is still a torch. My personal favourite is 'fairy lights,' which we boringly refer to as 'Christmas lights.'","[frustration, lights, name]",christmas
21,Victoria Moran,"'Make your plate look like a Christmas tree,' I tell people, 'mostly green with splashes of other bright colors.'","[tree, people, colors]",christmas

23,John Lydon,Having a birthday cake squashed into your face by young kids? Delicious. I always don a Santa suit at Christmas. Remaining childish is a tremendous state of innocence.,"[birthday, santa, cake]",christmas
24,Joseph Gatt,"Yep, I'm a geek. Ever since I got the Millennium Falcon for Christmas in 1978. And I still have it, in perfect condition, just without the box... but I still play with it!","[perfect, play, box]",christmas
25,Monica Johnson,"There is a lot to celebrate about that little Babe who was laid in a manger. Christians celebrate Christmas because they are thankful for the promise of salvation, which was delivered in human flesh and named Jesus.","[thankful, celebrate, jesus]",christmas
