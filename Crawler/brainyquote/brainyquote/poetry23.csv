0,Andrew Motion,"Thanks partly to the kind of poets that we now have and partly to funding, there's been a gigantic shift in the way poetry is perceived... Poems on the Underground, poets in schools, football clubs, zoos.","[football, thanks, way]",poetry
1,Andrew Motion,"I wanted to reimagine the role, in a way that was respectful of its traditional responsibilities but made them part of a wider pattern of poetry about national incidents, events, preoccupations; and to spend a great deal of time going to schools trying to demystify poetry.","[time, great, trying]",poetry
2,Andrew Motion,"While also, importantly, not wanting to dumb it down or pretend the days of 'difficult' poetry are over, because we live in a pluralist culture and there's room for 'difficult' poetry alongside rap and everything else. And poetry won't be for everyone, but everyone should have the choice.","[culture, choice, live]",poetry
3,Simon Armitage,I'd never really been content with just churning out these slim volumes every three or four years. I've always tried to think of poetry as an active ingredient in the language rather than just something that appears between the covers of thin books.,"[language, content, think]",poetry
4,Shelby Lynne,I can find some way to make poetry out of my life's experiences.,"[life, find, way]",poetry
5,Camille Paglia,I certainly derived my skills as a prose writer from my scrutiny of poetry and of the individual word. But schools don't do things like that anymore - tracking words down to their roots.,"[roots, words, down]",poetry
6,Lynda Barry,"The library was open for one hour after school let out. I hid there, looking at art books and reading poetry.","[art, school, reading]",poetry
7,Amy Winehouse,"I always wrote poetry and stuff like that, so putting songs together wasn't that spectacular.","[together, always, like]",poetry
8,David Duchovny,"Well, I still write poetry, but I wouldn't call myself a poet.","[myself, write, call]",poetry
9,Jane Campion,I have to admit that I had a lot of problems with poetry.,"[problems, admit, lot]",poetry
10,Jane Campion,"And, I mean, I think poetry does need to be met to some extent, especially, I guess, 19th century poetry, and for me, it's just been so worth the effort. It's like I'm planting a garden in my head.","[effort, me, think]",poetry
11,Joni Mitchell,I find a lot of poetry to be narcissistic.,"[find, narcissistic, lot]",poetry
12,Misha Collins,"Well, I like to write poetry. I'm a published poet.","[like, published, write]",poetry
13,Merritt Wever,"I used to joke that if acting didn't work out, poetry was my commonsense fallback.","[work, acting, joke]",poetry
14,Richard Hell,"Poetry's always dead, you know? You don't realize how good poetry is until 15 years later.","[good, know, you]",poetry
15,Nicholson Baker,"From my music training, I knew that, some Spanish rhythms apart, 5/4 is a time signature used only in the modern era. Holst's Mars from the Planets is 5/4. But if you speak lines of poetry in that pattern you just end up hitting the off-beats. It's only when you add a rest - a sixth beat - that it sounds as it surely should sound.","[music, time, end]",poetry
16,Nicholson Baker,"So I really began as a failed poet - although when I first wanted to be a writer, I learned to write prose by reading poetry.","[reading, first, writer]",poetry
17,James Lasdun,"The short story seems like the best of all possible worlds. I do feel it is closer to writing poetry than to writing a novel, with its requirements of concentration and economy.","[best, writing, short]",poetry
18,Mohsin Hamid,"Sufi poetry is, in a sense, self-help poetry about how to live a decent life, how to deal with your mortality.","[life, live, mortality]",poetry
19,Vikram Seth,"Why do writers, say, give up a job in economics and decide to write poetry? Or, why do they give up a job in a bank and decide to paint, like Krishan Khanna? They want to convey something.","[job, economics, want]",poetry
20,Yehuda Amichai,"I've often said that all poetry is political. This is because real poems deal with a human response to reality and politics is part of reality, history in the making. Even if a poet writes about sitting in a glass house drinking tea, it reflects politics.","[history, politics, tea]",poetry
21,Paul Engle,I wanted to write poetry almost a little more than I wanted to eat.,"[eat, more, almost]",poetry
22,Sharon Van Etten,I don't want to bury anything in poetry.,"[want, anything, bury]",poetry
23,Willem Dafoe,You can be intuitive when you've got a more expansive role. You can get into the poetry of telling the story rather than just pushing buttons.,"[story, you, role]",poetry
24,Mattie Stepanek,"Poetry is a beautiful way of expressing feelings - happy, sad, angry, caring. It's also a way that we share with other people, to help them with those feelings.","[sad, happy, beautiful]",poetry
25,Rafael Moneo,"I liked painting and drawing, and I liked humanities mainly - poetry, literature - this speculative attitude toward life.","[life, attitude, literature]",poetry
