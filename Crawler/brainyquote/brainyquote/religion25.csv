1,Chris Weitz,"'The Golden Compass' became a bad experience because the studio didn't have faith in the strength of the ideas of the novel, which is ironic because it's one of the greatest fantasy novels ever written, if not the greatest, and they took the religion out of it and tried to turn it into a popcorn movie.","[strength, experience, faith]",religion
2,Eli Roth,Possession and exorcism is something that's in every religion and every culture. It's a real primal fear: Is the body a vessel for our spirits? What happens if something else takes over it? Where does the spirit go?,"[fear, culture, body]",religion
3,Michael Bloomberg,I think one of the great dangers here is going and categorizing anybody from one religion as a terrorist. That's not true... That would let the terrorists win. That's what they want us to do.,"[great, win, want]",religion
4,Bruno Latour,"The only shibboleth the West has is science. It is the premise of modernity and it defines itself as a rationality capable of, indeed requiring separation from politics, religion and really, society. Modernisation is to work towards this.","[work, science, politics]",religion

9,Steven Pinker,"Broadly speaking, the Southern and Western desert and mountain states will vote for the candidate who endorses an aggressive military, a role for religion in public life, laissez-faire economic policies, private ownership of guns and relaxed conditions for using them, less regulation and taxation, and a valorization of the traditional family.","[life, family, mountain]",religion
10,Paul Johnson,"Marxism, Freudianism, global warming. These are proof - of which history offers so many examples - that people can be suckers on a grand scale.

11,Michael Sandel,"I grew up in a Jewish family, and we have raised our children in a Jewish tradition. Religion gives a framework for moral enquiry in young minds and points us to questions beyond the material.","[family, children, questions]",religion

16,Umberto Eco,"It is psychologically very hard to go through life without the justification, and the hope, provided by religion.","[life, hope, without]",religion
17,Adam Savage,"I'm actually the fourth generation in my family to have no practical use for the church, or God, or religion. My children continue this trend.","[family, god, children]",religion
18,Madonna Ciccone,"I have a funny relationship with religion. I'm a big believer in ritualistic behavior as long as it doesn't hurt anybody. But I'm not a big fan of rules. And yet, we cannot live in a world without order.","[funny, relationship, world]",religion
19,Marilyn Manson,"In a sense, terrorism blossomed in the advent of television. Television promotes terrorism in religion and in politics.","[politics, advent, terrorism]",religion

21,F. Sionil Jose,"Cultural values are, in themselves, neutral as well as universal, and so much depends on how individuals or ethnic groups use them. Values are influenced by so many factors such as geography, climate, religion, the economy and technology.","[technology, values, economy]",religion
