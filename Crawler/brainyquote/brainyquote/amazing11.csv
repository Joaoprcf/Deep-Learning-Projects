3,Junot Diaz,"You see, in my view a writer is a writer not because she writes well and easily, because she has amazing talent, because everything she does is golden.

13,Antoine Predock,"The connection to place, to the land, the wind, the sun, stars, the moon... it sounds romantic, but it's true - the visceral experience of motion, of moving through time on some amazing machine - a few cars touch on it, but not too many compared to motorcycles.

21,Thomas Mars,"Some amazing records have this power to leave you with inspiration; you're left with the urge to write something. And some records are totally overwhelming, because they are so good, they burn the bridges behind them.","[good, power, bridges]",amazing

24,Malaika Arora Khan,"I guess I'm a good manager now. Moreover, I'm loving the concept of donning the producer's hat. It's all very exciting as well as a great learning experience.
