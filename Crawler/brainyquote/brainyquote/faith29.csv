0,Joel Osteen,"I believe that when you think of the negative, and you get up discouraged - 'There's nothing good in my future' - I really believe it almost ties the hands of God. God works where there's an attitude of faith. I believe faith is all about hope.","[hope, future, god]",faith
1,Sandra Bullock,"No one has proof that I know of, that a higher power exists, yet a major portion of the world believes in it and relies on it in faith in trust, in what that is. Where is the science in that? And yet you have incredible belief in that.","[trust, science, power]",faith
2,Jeremy Lin,"In many ways, the longer I live, I understand that there are so many things outside my control. That's why I believe faith is such a big part of the story. There are so many things that were orchestrated by God, that were put into place to make this perfect storm, that created Linsanity.","[god, believe, storm]",faith
3,Jeremy Lin,"Faith, family, academics and then sports was the order of priorities in my family. My parents really stuck to these principles when raising me and my two brothers.

4,Phil Robertson,"Two of the central ingredients to our family are food and faith, so sitting down together and thanking God for the food He's provided means everything to us. Prayer is a natural part of our lives - not only around the dinner table, but all day long.","[family, food, god]",faith
5,A. P. J. Abdul Kalam,"All wars signify the failure of conflict resolution mechanisms, and they need post-war rebuilding of faith, trust and confidence.","[trust, failure, confidence]",faith

7,Lech Walesa,"I'm a man of faith. I only fear God, and my wife - sometimes.","[god, fear, man]",faith
8,John Piper,"God revealed himself through the Law, which pointed to Christ as its end and goal, commanded the obedience that comes from faith, increased transgressions, and shut the mouths of all humans because no one has performed the righteousness of the Law so as not to need a substitute.","[god, end, goal]",faith

11,Huston Smith,"The faith I was born into formed me. I come from a missionary family - I grew up in China - and in my case, my religious upbringing was positive. Of course, not everyone has this experience. I know many of my students are what I have come to think of as wounded Christians or wounded Jews.","[positive, family, experience]",faith
12,Richard Dawkins,Religion is capable of driving people to such dangerous folly that faith seems to me to qualify as a kind of mental illness.,"[religion, people, me]",faith

15,Lewis B. Smedes,"As I read the New Testament, I find only one path to salvation - the path of an informed faith in Jesus Christ.","[path, find, informed]",faith
16,John Edwards,My faith informs everything I think and do. It's part of my value system. And to suggest that I can somehow separate and divorce that from the rest of me is not possible.,"[value, me, divorce]",faith
17,Jake Roberts,"I'm not really into religion, OK. I saw a lot of things I did not like when I got into organized religion. I think a lot of people abuse it, I think a lot of people use it, I think a lot of people make it what they want. And me, my faith and my relationship with God is very personal. And it's not anybody's damn business how we talk.","[relationship, business, god]",faith
18,Edward McKendree Bounds,"Bible revelations are not against reason but above reason, for the uses of faith, man's highest faculty.","[man, bible, reason]",faith

23,Eugene Kennedy,"The truth of faith is a slender, glowing element that runs through even the seemingly ordinary and undramatic moments of existence.

Such religious truth is powerful even when it seems faint, even when it seems obscured by the larger events of history.","[history, truth, moments]",faith
24,Juan Pablo Di Pace,"Religious or biblical can sometimes be a little soft, but 'A.D.' doesn't shy away from the violence of the time, the political intrigue. The story is really about the resurrection of faith, which is how the disciples went about keeping the word of Christ. So, they found all kinds of trouble and problems and torture and persecution.","[time, violence, political]",faith
25,John Edgar Wideman,"I don't understand why black people have been so quiescent, so passive over the hundreds of years of American history. Why hasn't there been more violence, more armed struggle? I know answers to some of that, but it seems to me it's an issue of faith, an abiding faith in some sort of great beyond, or great spirit, or even in the American dream.","[history, great]",faith
