0,C. V. Raman,"In the history of science, we often find that the study of some natural phenomenon has been the starting point in the development of a new branch of knowledge.","[knowledge, history, find]",science
1,Jules Verne,"The Yankees, the first mechanicians in the world, are engineers - just as the Italians are musicians and the Germans metaphysicians - by right of birth. Nothing is more natural, therefore, than to perceive them applying their audacious ingenuity to the science of gunnery.","[musicians, world, engineers]",science
2,Oscar Wilde,"In England, an inventor is regarded almost as a crazy man, and in too many instances, invention ends in disappointment and poverty. In America, an inventor is honoured, help is forthcoming, and the exercise of ingenuity, the application of science to the work of man, is there the shortest road to wealth.","[work, road, man]",science
3,Gail Carriger,"I like certain subgenres within science fiction and fantasy, and one of those is urban fantasy, and another is steampunk.","[fiction, within, urban]",science
4,Mario J. Molina,I attended elementary school and high school in Mexico City. I was already fascinated by science before entering high school; I still remember my excitement when I first glanced at paramecia and amoebae through a rather primitive toy microscope.,"[school, city, remember]",science
5,Rudolf Steiner,"The true teachers and educators are not those who have learned pedagogy as the science of dealing with children, but those in whom pedagogy has awakened through understanding the human being.","[children, true]",science
6,John L. Phillips,"We're going to be focusing our science on things that will take us farther and longer into space. For many of those experiments, the crew members are human guinea pigs, which is fine; that's part of my job. I don't mind being a human guinea pig.","[mind, job, space]",science
7,Viswanathan Anand,"I love travelling and going on wildlife safaris. I have an interest in astronomy. I like reading on current affairs, business and science. I love doing nothing if I can help it.","[love, business, reading]",science
8,David Hilbert,"How thoroughly it is ingrained in mathematical science that every real advance goes hand in hand with the invention of sharper tools and simpler methods which, at the same time, assist in understanding earlier theories and in casting aside some more complicated developments.","[time, understanding, tools]",science
9,Henry W. Kendall,"Many people and governments share the mistaken belief that science, with new, ingenious devices and techniques, can rescue us from the troubles we face without our having to mend our ways and change our patterns of activity. This is not so.","[change, people, face]",science

11,Rod Serling,"There is a fifth dimension, beyond that which is known to man. It is a dimension as vast as space and as timeless as infinity. It is the middle ground between light and shadow, between science and superstition.","[light, man, shadow]",science
12,James Sanborn,"I chose to deal with the science of cryptography. Cryptography began in mathematics. Codes were developed, even from Caesar's time, based on number theory and mathematical principles. I decided to use those principles and designed a work that is encoded.","[work, time, mathematics]",science
13,J. Robert Oppenheimer,It is a profound and necessary truth that the deep things in science are not found because they are useful; they were found because it was possible to find them.,"[truth, deep, find]",science

18,Max Planck,"A scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.","[light, truth, generation]",science

20,Henrik Ibsen,It is inexcusable for scientists to torture animals; let them make their experiments on journalists and politicians.,"[animals, torture]",science
21,Sally Ride,Science is fun. Science is curiosity. We all have natural curiosity. Science is a process of investigating. It's posing questions and coming up with a method. It's delving in.,"[curiosity, fun, questions]",science
22,Frederick Sanger,Scientific research is one of the most exciting and rewarding of occupations.,"[research, most]",science
