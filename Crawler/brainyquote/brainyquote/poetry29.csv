0,John Burnside,"With fiction, I tend to get to my desk and start writing. Poetry I write in my head, often while walking, so that my poems have an organic quality, hopefully.","[quality, writing, walking]",poetry
1,John Burnside,I realised I'd spent a lot of time in my poetry trying to find a way of talking about that whereof we cannot speak.,"[time, trying, speak]",poetry
2,Philippe Petit,"I am fascinated by the engineering. The science of constructing and understanding why it stands. And I am drawn by the madness, the beauty, the theatricality, the poetry and soul of the wire. And you cannot be a wire-walker without mingling those two ways of seeing life.","[life, beauty, science]",poetry
3,Philippe Petit,"If I have to make a self-portrait, I would put poetry and rebellion on the list. To be able to walk on a wire, to be able to juggle six hoops, you need focus, another word for tenacity, which is passion.","[passion, focus, walk]",poetry
4,Philippe Petit,"I was born in a world of opera, theatre, films, poetry, art, and therefore, out of the wire, I made a stage. That's why they call me a high wire artist.","[art, theatre, world]",poetry
5,Elizabeth Edwards,"I was a 16-year-old girl at one point, so of course I wrote poetry.","[girl, point, wrote]",poetry
6,Paul Auster,"I guess I wanted to leave America for awhile. It wasn't that I wanted to become an expatriate, or just never come back, I needed some breathing room. I'd already been translating French poetry, I'd been to Paris once before and liked it very much, and so I just went.","[america, leave, paris]",poetry
7,Paul Auster,"I was always interested in French poetry sort of as a sideline to my own work, I was translating contemporary French poets. That kind of spilled out into translation as a way to earn money, pay for food and put bread on the table.","[work, food, money]",poetry
8,Paul Auster,"I started out in life as a poet; I was only writing poetry all through my 20s. It wasn't until I was about 30 that I got serious about writing prose. While I was writing poems, I would often divert myself by reading detective novels; I liked them.","[life, myself, writing]",poetry
9,B. B. King,"Cotton was a force of nature. There's a poetry to it, hoeing and growing cotton.","[nature, growing, force]",poetry
10,Amanda Seyfried,"I have written some songs, but I would really call what I've done poetry at the end of the day, because I'll sit with my guitar for hours and hours on end for, like, a week and then I won't touch it for a month. I also just have no confidence. And you know what? I don't have time, because I'd rather be doing other things, like knitting.","[time, confidence, end]",poetry
11,Jewel,"I think when kids just see well-crafted poetry, it's just obtuse to them. It's hard to relate to.","[think, see, kids]",poetry
12,Jewel,"I've always had a love for poetry and when I got signed to a record label I thought, 'How odd that I'm doing a record before a book of poetry,'","[love, book, thought]",poetry
13,Vincent Cassel,I'm moving to Rio permanently with my family. It's one of the places left in the world where people still live with a big charge of poetry on a daily basis. I feel we've kind of lost that here in Europe.,"[family, daily, moving]",poetry
14,Michael Franti,Every single soul is a poem.,"[soul, single, every]",poetry
15,Justin Cartwright,A connection between poetry and blindness is a classical trope.,"[connection, blindness]",poetry
16,Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel,"Women are treated as unjustly in poetry as in life. The feminine ones are not idealistic, and the idealistic not feminine.","[life, women, treated]",poetry
17,Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel,"From what the moderns want, we must learn what poetry should become; from what the ancients did, what poetry must be.","[learn, want, should]",poetry
18,Mark Haddon,I like poetry when I don't quite understand why I like it. Poetry isn't just a question of wrapping something up and giving it to someone else to unwrap. It just doesn't work like that.,"[work, giving, someone]",poetry
19,Stephen Colbert,"I wrote things for the school's newspaper, and - like all teenagers - I dabbled in poetry.","[school, newspaper, teenagers]",poetry
20,Rebecca Ferguson,I like to write poetry.,"[like, write]",poetry
21,Billy Collins,"The poem is not, as someone put it, deflective of entry. But the real question is, 'What happens to the reader once he or she gets inside the poem?' That's the real question for me, is getting the reader into the poem and then taking the reader somewhere, because I think of poetry as a kind of form of travel writing.","[travel, writing, me]",poetry
22,Billy Collins,"Often people, when they're confronted with a poem, it's like someone who keep saying 'what is the meaning of this? What is the meaning of this?' And that dulls us to the other pleasures poetry offers.","[people, meaning, someone]",poetry
23,Billy Collins,"There are interesting forms of difficulty, and there are unprofitable forms of difficulty. I mean, I enjoy some difficult poetry, but some of it is impenetrable and I actually wouldn't want to penetrate it if I could, perhaps.","[enjoy, want, difficult]",poetry
24,Billy Collins,"Radio is such a perfect medium for the transmission of poetry, primarily because there just is the voice, there's no visual distraction.","[voice, perfect, distraction]",poetry
25,Billy Collins,Listeners are kind of ambushed... if a poem just happens to be said when they're listening to the radio. The listener doesn't have time to deploy what I call their 'poetry deflector shields' that were installed in high school - there's little time to resist the poem.,"[time, school, listening]",poetry
