9,Virginia Postrel,"When 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' premiered on the WB Network in 1996, American culture was in trouble.

17,S. C. Gwynne,"What I am afraid of is the first thing I was ever aware of being afraid of and what I have told my daughter countless times she need not fear: being alone in the dark.
