0,Michael Patrick King,"The thing you can't let go of is gravity. The reality of gravity in writing. If someone says something really mean in a sitcom, and the next wave isn't a reaction to the reality of that, you start losing relatability. In a lot of romantic comedies, they throw out the rules of life.","[life, losing, writing]",romantic
1,Eavan Boland,"It is certainly true that writers take a stance at some variance from organized religion. This has not always been true.

6,Meghan Markle,"At the end of the day, if the guy is going to write the girl a letter, whether it's chicken scratch or scribble or looks like a doctor's note, if he takes the time to put pen to paper and not type something, there's something so incredibly romantic and beautiful about that.","[time, beautiful, end]",romantic

9,Ruth Glick,Nobody's life is as romantic as it is in fiction.,"[life, fiction, nobody]",romantic
10,Ruth Glick,"For me, the perfect romantic suspense hero has got to be tough on the outside but tender at his core. A take-charge kind of guy who has his own inner strength and a strong sense of right and wrong - which might not dovetail with the conventional wisdom. I mean, he might bend the law if he thinks the ends justify the means.","[strength, wisdom, hero]",romantic

18,Nimrat Kaur,"I am a pretty emotional person. Any act of kindness or unkindness moves me. When I see a romantic couple sitting by the beach, it moves me. I don't break down or crack under pressure, but I am just sensitive.","[kindness, i am, beach]",romantic
