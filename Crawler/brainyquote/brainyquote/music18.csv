1,Alice Englert,"It's a bit like school camp, shooting a film. Everyone's on heat. It's a strange energy. It's full of adrenalin. I funnel my excess energy in funny little ways. I do a lot of dancing in my trailer. I love music.","[funny, love, school]",music
2,Theo James,"I was in the school plays, I did a lot of music. I carried on through university for short films and loads of plays.","[school, short, university]",music

4,Janelle Monae,"I have a great body, I really do. But I want to be taken seriously as an artist, and wearing anything that shows it off will be a distraction from the music. That's how my signature uniform, my tuxedo, came about. It's classic and timeless. You'll see me in black, white, and a pop of color on my lips. That pop adds a little magic.","[great, black, color]",music
5,Charles Frazier,"If I had to give up reading or give up listening to music, I suspect I'd stick with the music.","[reading, listening, stick]",music
6,Carrie Ann Inaba,"I wasn't a ballet baby. My first dance class was in an outdoor pavilion when I was three. It was called 'creative movement.' The teacher gave us chiffon scarves in beautiful colors. She turned on some music and said, 'Now go dance.' So for me, dance has always been about self-expression.","[teacher, beautiful, dance]",music
7,Nas,"Hip-hop is the streets. Hip-hop is a couple of elements that it comes from back in the days... that feel of music with urgency that speaks to you. It speaks to your livelihood and it's not compromised. It's blunt. It's raw, straight off the street - from the beat to the voice to the words.","[voice, words, hip-hop]",music

11,Trevor St. John,"Jazz music and, more specifically, jazz musicians, are my artistic heroes. I want to be the Thelonious Monk of acting. He had no concern for how well he was received. He played whatever he wanted whenever he wanted. He just wasn't interested in achieving the good opinion of his audience. That's the Holy Grail of acting; of any art form.","[art, good, achieving]",music

15,Tiesto,"Napster is great so long as they put out tracks on there that have been officially released. I don't really mind people downloading my music; I also see it as a compliment.

16,Tiesto,"I've always wanted to be a DJ so I could play the music I love for other people. That feeling hasn't changed, but my sets are always evolving.

It's a different feel, for example, in a small club versus a festival.","[love, small, people]",music

18,Ellen G. White,"When music is allowed to take the place of devotion and prayer, it is a terrible curse. Young people assemble together to sing, and, although professed Christians, frequently dishonor God and their faith by their frivolous conversation and their choice of music.","[god, faith, together]",music
19,Ellen G. White,"Every act, every deed of justice and mercy and benevolence, makes heavenly music in Heaven.","[justice, mercy, heaven]",music
20,Hans Zimmer,"If something happened where I couldn't write music anymore, it would kill me. It's not just a job. It's not just a hobby. It's why I get up in the morning.","[morning, job, me]",music
21,Daphne Guinness,There hasn't been anything real since grunge. That was the last movement led by music or an art form.,"[art, real, movement]",music
22,Priyanka Chopra,"I don't come from a film background. I haven't learned anything about films or film-making. But I have a thirst to know everything about my profession. I want to learn about cinematography, about editing, about music recordings, about post-production. So when people in the know talk, I willingly listen.","[people, learn, know]",music

25,Ahmet Ertegun,"Soul lyrics, soul music came at about the same time as the civil rights movement, and it's very possible that one influenced the other.","[time, soul, civil rights]",music
