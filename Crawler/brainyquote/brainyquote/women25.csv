4,Ban Ki-moon,"Throughout human history, in any great endeavour requiring the common effort of many nations and men and women everywhere, we have learned - it is only through seriousness of purpose and persistence that we ultimately carry the day.

23,Vera Wang,"As the mother of two daughters, I have great respect for women. And I don't ever want to lose that.","[respect, mother, great]",women
24,Suzanne Somers,"What I really need is for people to know that I don't just do this, I do this and this and this and this.
