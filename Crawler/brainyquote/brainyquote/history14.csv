0,Joel Osteen,"Yes, the Bible should be taught in our schools because it is necessary to understand the Bible if we are to truly understand our own culture and how it came to be. The Bible has influenced every part of western culture from our art, music, and history, to our sense of fairness, charity, and business.","[music, art, business]",history

2,William Gibson,"I don't think nostalgia is a healthy modality. But nostalgia and a sense of history are not the same thing. Nostalgia is a dysfunction of the historical impulse, or a corruption of the historical impulse.","[corruption, healthy, think]",history

8,Chiang Kai-shek,"In the early days of the Russian Revolution in 1917, I was completely in sympathy with it. I felt that it established a new era in the history of the modern world.

If people condemned the Communist party, I would speak in its defense.","[sympathy, world, people]",history
9,Ray Bradbury,"If you are going to describe the history of animation, you'd look at the early Disney work, then 'Bugs Bunny,' 'Road Runner' and other Warner Brothers theatrical productions. But when you got to 'Rocky and Bullwinkle,' you'd see they were unique: They assumed you had a brain in your head.","[work, road, brain]",history
10,Rose George,"Rules governing defecation, hygiene, and pollution exist in every culture at every period in history. It may in fact be the foundation of civilization: What is toilet training if not the first attempt to turn a child into an acceptable member of society?","[culture, society, training]",history
11,Noam Chomsky,"Britain kept its position as the dominant world power well into the 20th century despite steady decline. By the end of World War II, dominance had shifted decisively into the hands of the upstart across the sea, the United States, by far the most powerful and wealthy society in world history.","[war, power, end]",history

13,Noam Chomsky,"By curious accident of history and geography, the world's major energy resources are located pretty much in Shiite regions. They're a minority in the Middle East, but they happen to be where the oil is, right around the northern part of the Gulf.","[world, energy, happen]",history
14,Noam Chomsky,"The 1950s and 1960s had been a period of enormous growth, the highest in American history, maybe in economic history.","[growth, american, economic]",history
15,Noam Chomsky,"I stated that Hiroshima and Nagasaki are 'among the most unspeakable crimes in history.' I took no position on just where they stand on the scale of horrors relative to Auschwitz, the bombing of Chungking, Lidice, and so on.","[stand, hiroshima, most]",history
16,Alan Arkin,"I love insane, stupid comedy, but I can only make it work if it's a character I can give some history to and make real. Like the guy I played in 'Little Miss Sunshine.' He's a maniac, but to me he was absolutely believable.","[love, work, character]",history

21,Jamie Johnson,"Personally, I can't see the appeal in trekking down to D.C. for a networking extravaganza, even if it is built around a special moment in American history. While I find the election of Barack Obama inspirational, I don't have a desire to memorialize it with overly effusive celebration.","[inspirational, election]",history
22,Edmund White,"The Stonewall riots were a key moment for gay people. Throughout modern history, gays had thought of themselves as something like a mental illness or maybe a sin or a crime.

25,Guy Gavriel Kay,"When we work with history, to a very great degree we are all guessing.
