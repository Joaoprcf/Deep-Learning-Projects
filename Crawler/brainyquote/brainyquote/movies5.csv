0,Francis Ford Coppola,"Steven Spielberg is unique. I feel that the kinds of movies he loves are the same kinds of movies that the big mass audience loves. He's very fortunate because he can do the things he naturally likes the best, and he's been very successful.","[best, unique, successful]",movies
1,Rob Zombie,I like movies where you can come back and re-watch them and admire the cinematography 25 years later.,"[you, admire, cinematography]",movies
2,Frank Ocean,"Whenever I think about movies, I always look at that art process as having the best of a lot of worlds. Because if you watch a great film, you have a musical element to it, not just on the scoring, but in the way that the shots are edited - that has music and rhythm and time.","[music, best, time]",movies
3,Jonah Hill,"I really care about this stuff, I care about movies, and you just have to be strong and don't be stupid; freedom of choice is a big responsibility, and I'm lucky enough not to have to just take any movie to pay the rent, so there's no need to be greedy.","[freedom, responsibility]",movies
4,Norman Reedus,"Oh, I love horror movies, yeah.","[love, horror, horror movies]",movies
5,Marlon Wayans,"So, I was sitting there and I watched 'Paranormal Activity' and I was like, 'Boy, white people do dumb stuff in movies.' So I was like, 'Why don't they just leave the house... What if paranormal activity happened to a black couple?'","[black, people, dumb]",movies
6,Dylan O'Brien,I moved to California when I was twelve and I got a video camera and made little movies because I didn't have any friends yet. I would force my sister to make these movies with me - which became my YouTube channel.,"[sister, friends, me]",movies
7,Emma Roberts,"I've always wanted to get into acting, ever since I was younger. I'd put on shows for my family and run around play dress-up all the time. I think I was 4 when I told them I wanted to do movies.","[family, time, acting]",movies
8,Lloyd Kaufman,"The thing I find about the movie industry is that 99 percent of the people are absolute scum. They're horrible people, they really are. Very nasty killer rabbits who hate movies. But the other 1 percent are really the greatest, most wonderful people in the world.","[greatest, hate, world]",movies
9,James Roday,"I was a strange, dark little dude. I fell in love with horror movies, at a very early age. Somehow, as a first grader, I was able to convince my parents to let me go see stuff like 'An American Werewolf in London' in theaters, so I was headed in that direction anyway.","[love, age, parents]",movies
10,Sebastian Thrun,"The Jetsons had them in the 1960s. They were the defining element of 'Knight Rider' in the 1980s: cars that drive themselves. Self-driving cars appear in countless science fiction movies. By Hollywood standards, they are so normal we don't even notice them. But in real life, they still don't exist. What if you could buy one today?","[life, science, today]",movies
11,Gore Verbinski,"I like horror movies, and in fact I like them even more now after making one. I just think they're much more liberating because you don't really have to apply a very strict logic.","[logic, think, you]",movies
12,Nicholas Jarecki,"Why is the public so interested in movies about the wealthy? My answer is that Shakespeare wrote about kings. That's where the action is. And it's the classic, cathartic thing. You get to indulge in a lifestyle you're not part of, a tragic error leads to a downfall, and you get to say, 'Thank God I'm not him.'","[god, thank god, action]",movies
13,Alfonso Cuaron,"'Y Tu Mama Tambien' is one of the first unrated movies to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. But many video stores won't take a movie that's not rated, so I had to make the movie an R.","[best, award, original]",movies
14,Joss Whedon,"Horror movies don't exist unless you go and see them, and people always will.","[people, see, you]",movies
15,Joss Whedon,"The way a musical can make us feel is unlike anything else, in song and particularly in dance. I think people fly through plate-glass windows when they get shot because movies don't have dance scenes any more. This is what we do instead.","[dance, people, fly]",movies
16,Salman Khan,"In the past, I had a knee-jerk approach to work, and it showed on screen. I was doing movies for the wrong reasons - trying to juggle dates, do too many guest appearances, take up projects under pressure or for emotional reasons.","[work, past, trying]",movies
17,Elizabeth Gillies,"Hopefully, after 'Victorious' has lived a long and beautiful life, I would like to go into movies. And I'd like to have a very successful movie career. Ultimately I'd love to win an Oscar; that's my big goal in life, so that's what I'm going for.","[life, love, beautiful]",movies
18,Ashton Kutcher,"In the movies, you want a good story and characters that are honest, but you are also looking for a good director who can lead the ship. That's how we look at business. Everybody has a great idea for a start-up, and so do their relatives, and they tell me, 'You gotta build it.' I say, 'I have to believe in it.'","[business, good, great]",movies
19,Bill Burr,"I love making movies, and being in any that I can be in. I'd like to be in those giant movies, as the fifth or sixth lead, and have three or four killer scenes. You don't have the responsibility of the entire movie being on you. I like those roles. I'm shooting for the middle.","[love, responsibility, you]",movies
20,Sylvester Stallone,"In the movies, I kill guys with an axe. In real life, I can't control a nine-year-old girl.","[life, girl, control]",movies
21,Jodie Foster,"If I make two movies my entire life, and they're two movies that - whether they make a lot of money or two people go to see them - they speak of me, then I consider them incredibly successful. I don't need to be Steven Spielberg.","[life, money, people]",movies
22,Jodie Foster,"As an actor, I'm attracted to drama; as a director, it's humor - because it's the story of my life, and I can't be that serious about it. Being alone is a big theme in all my movies, both as a director and as an actress.","[life, alone, humor]",movies
23,Matt Groening,"There's always room out there for the hand-drawn image. I personally like the imperfection of hand drawing as opposed to the slick look of computer animation. But you can do good stuff either way. The Pixar movies are amazing in what they do, but there's plenty of independent animators who are doing really amazing things as well.","[good, amazing, drawing]",movies
24,Joss Whedon,"I go to movies expecting to have a whole experience. If I want a movie that doesn't end, I'll go to a French movie. That's a betrayal of trust to me. A movie has to be complete within itself; it can't just build off the first one or play variations.","[trust, experience, end]",movies
25,Neil deGrasse Tyson,"Stephen Hawking's been watching too many Hollywood movies. I think the only kind aliens in Hollywood are the ones created by Steven Spielberg - 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' and 'E.T.,' for example. All other aliens are trying to suck our brains out.","[trying, think, watching]",movies
