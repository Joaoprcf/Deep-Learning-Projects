0,Reggie Bush,"I play football, and most football players are camera shy. We just want to be left alone; we just want to stick to what we do.","[football, camera, want]",alone
1,Rory Culkin,"I only work once or twice a year for about a month, so I have a lot of free time. But I'm good at being alone, which helps.","[work, time, good]",alone
2,Mia Sara,"Rick Owens is my desert island designer. I could live in his clothes alone, and I collect Ossie Clark.","[live, desert, island]",alone
3,Sunny Mabrey,"I've always loved the rush you get from watching a really scary movie, but I never watch them alone. It's fun to turn out the lights and scream and clutch someone's hand and spill the popcorn all over the place and hide under each other.","[fun, lights, loved]",alone
4,Rahul Dravid,"I wasn't the most prodigiously talented cricketer in Karnataka, let alone India. Some of my team-mates in my school team could hit the ball cleaner than I do. I had to work through that lack of talent, so to speak, that lack of natural flair. Runs never came easy for me.","[work, school, team]",alone
5,Brian Bonsall,"I don't think I could compare myself to Macaulay Culkin, because we're pretty much two different kinds of actors. He's done a lot of comedy. He does mostly just comedy like 'Uncle Buck' and 'Home Alone' and 'Home Alone 2.' And I've done a lot of different stuff, like sad movies, like the movie about the kid with AIDS.","[home, sad, myself]",alone
6,Yoko Ono,"The universe, when you leave it alone, is going to be beautiful.","[beautiful, universe, you]",alone
7,John Zorn,I don't ascribe to the idea of the ivory tower composer who sits alone in a room composing his masterpieces and then comes down from Mount Sinai with the tablets. It doesn't work like that. The job of a composer is putting something down on a piece of paper that will inspire the person who's playing.,"[work, job, inspire]",alone
8,Chuck Palahniuk,"When I first started writing, it was me alone with a computer in my apartment. I hated the time away from other people, and my writing sucked. Now I have a laptop; I can do the most tedious part of my job in a public place.","[time, writing, job]",alone
9,Noam Chomsky,"If you look back at the history of the twentieth century, Germany alone had practically destroyed Russia several times.","[history, look, you]",alone
10,Tim Huelskamp,"Some men don't want to be responsible fathers. It's easier to say 'Let's just turn the kids over to the state.' Women end up bearing the entire load, raising kids alone without a husband to share the parenting.","[women, parenting, end]",alone
11,Rose Leslie,"I believe that we're not alone. How can we be alone in an infinite universe? I'm using the word 'alien' with a little trepidation because I know that sparks so many different versions of that word, and there are so many different images that come into one person's head when someone says it.","[believe, universe, alien]",alone
12,Laurie Halse Anderson,"That can be the most painstaking aspect of being a teen, figuring out what the world really looks like. If you find someone in a book, you know you're not alone and that's what's so comforting about books.","[teen, book, world]",alone
13,Edmund White,"Part of my problem as a young writer was that I was too much a New Yorker, always second-guessing the 'market.' I became so discouraged that I decided to write something that would please me alone - that became my sole criterion. And that was when I wrote 'Forgetting Elena,' the first novel I got published.","[problem, me, young]",alone
14,Garcelle Beauvais,Adultery is the ultimate deal-breaker for me. I would rather be alone than in a relationship that doesn't honor me.,"[relationship, honor, me]",alone

17,Al Lopez,"The manager is by himself. He can't mingle with his players. I enjoyed my players, but I could not socialize with them so I spent a lot of time alone in my hotel room. Those four walls kind of close in on you.","[time, you, kind]",alone
18,Denis Waitley,Don't ever let economic alone determine your career or how you spend the majority of your time.,"[time, career, you]",alone
19,Joe Lieberman,"You know, I respect what Howard Dean has been able to do. It's good for our party. But I've got to tell you this: If money alone decided presidential nominations, Phil Gramm would have been nominated in '96.","[money, respect, good]",alone
20,Thomas Bailey Aldrich,"They fail, and they alone, who have not striven.","[fail, who]",alone
21,Louis Aragon,"Fear of error which everything recalls to me at every moment of the flight of my ideas, this mania for control, makes men prefer reason's imagination to the imagination of the senses. And yet it is always the imagination alone which is at work.","[work, fear, imagination]",alone
22,Comte de Lautreamont,Taste is the fundamental quality which sums up all the other qualities. It is the nec plus ultra of the intelligence. Through this alone is genius the supreme health and balance of all the faculties.,"[health, intelligence]",alone
23,E. W. Howe,"For every quarrel a man and wife have before others, they have a hundred when alone.","[man, wife, others]",alone
