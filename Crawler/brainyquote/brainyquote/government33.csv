0,Ben Carson,"Health care is one-sixth of our economy. If the government can control that, they can control just about everything. We need to understand what is going on, because there are much more economic models that can be used to give us good health care than what we have now.","[health, good, good health]",government
1,Ben Carson,Nobody is starving on the streets. We've always taken care of them. We take care of our own; we always have. It is not the government's responsibility.,"[responsibility, care]",government
2,Gary Bauer,"Republicans rarely criticize Obama for lack of empathy - in part because liberals have traditionally been seen as standing up for the weak and the vulnerable. Conservatives can be just as empathetic. But they believe that, in most cases, it's not government's role to be the primary dispenser of empathy.","[empathy, believe, role]",government
3,Ahmed Chalabi,Sectarian politics gets votes in Iraq. But sectarian government fails in Iraq.,"[politics, iraq, fails]",government
4,Bob Barr,"Taking privacy cues from the federal government is - to say the least - ironic, considering today's Orwellian level of surveillance. At virtually any given time outside of one's own home, an American citizen can reasonably assume his movements and actions are being monitored by something, by somebody, somewhere.","[time, home, today]",government
5,Mark Skousen,"Millions of Americans were duped by the federal government and the Federal Reserve into buying homes they could not afford and failed to count the cost. When the financial crisis of 2008 hit, they could not keep up the monthly mortgage payments and defaulted.","[financial, crisis]",government
6,Richard Mourdock,"I think the best thing we can do is sell that idea of smaller government - of fiscal responsibility vs. the Obama record. Obama made promises, and on every promise in which he's actually delivered, things have gotten worse instead of better. He said if we get ObamaCare it'll help, but health care prices went up.","[best, health, responsibility]",government
7,Sean Quinn,"Let's not forget, it was the government, Department of Finance and Central Bank that decided to unfairly land the taxpayers of this country with unmitigated losses of Anglo and massive legacy issues that would have been expected when nationalising a fraudulent bank.","[legacy, finance, forget]",government
8,Tony Judt,"American social arrangements, economic arrangements, the degree of inequality in American life, the relatively small role played by the government in American public life and so forth, compares to exactly the opposite conditions in most of the European societies.","[life, small, american]",government
9,John Paul DeJoria,"In philanthropy, many of us give a little bit and each year we give more and more to see what actually works and not just throw money out there and see if it's going to work. If the government did the same thing, fabulous.","[work, money, year]",government
10,Gail Collins,"If you live in a place that you perceive to be a crowded place, you appreciate government; you see it as this thing that protects you against crime, that keeps order, that makes sure that nobody puts a massage parlor next to your house, that keeps other people's dogs from pooping on the sidewalk.","[people, appreciate, live]",government
11,Matt Taibbi,"2008 was to the American economy what 9/11 was to national security. Yet while 9/11 prompted the U.S. government to tear up half the Constitution in the name of public safety, after 2008, authorities went in the other direction.","[safety, constitution]",government
12,Matt Taibbi,"The failure to work out sensible budgets makes it impossible for government agencies to make long-term plans, and instead leaves them scrambling to spend money in the short term.","[work, money, failure]",government
13,Daphne Guinness,"We need a government, not politics. Because there's too much politics. Of course there should be debate. But there seems to be so much pettiness and not enough good faith. It is civilized to agree to disagree, and this idea is slowly disintegrating. The great statesmen of the past knew this, and I think it helps drive civilization.","[faith, good, great]",government
14,Lysander Spooner,"Any number of scoundrels, having money enough to start with, can establish themselves as a 'government'; because, with money, they can hire soldiers, and with soldiers extort more money; and also compel general obedience to their will.","[money, soldiers, start]",government
15,Tibor Kalman,"Let's face it: we live at a time when government is less and less powerful, less and less effective, and the agent of social change, at least for the immediate future, is the corporation.","[change, time, future]",government
16,Thomas Sowell,"Even if the government spends itself into bankruptcy and the economy still does not recover, Keynesians can always say that it would have worked if only the government had spent more.","[economy, say, always]",government
17,Joe Lhota,"Government should steer, not row.","[should, row, steer]",government
18,Tony Campolo,My task as a citizen is to get the government to do more good and less inefficient and wasteful work.,"[work, good, citizen]",government
19,Dick Cheney,"The Federal Reserve, the Treasury, all the regulator agencies - if there's a problem of the financial mechanism in society, the only one to fix it is government. They've got a legitimate role.","[society, problem, financial]",government
20,Buzz Aldrin,I think there would be no shortage of applicants to the government astronaut corps to be settlers on the planet Mars. And I think this would be very inspiring.,"[mars, think, planet]",government
21,Eric Idle,"I like being a foreigner. For me, to live in California is very pleasant - I'm more comfortable not feeling a part of everything, not feeling responsible for the government or the roads or the health system.","[health, me, live]",government
22,Bonnie Raitt,"In 1967 I entered Harvard as a freshman, confident - in the way that only 17-year-olds are - that I could change the world. My major was African Studies, and my plan was to travel to Tanzania, where President Julius Nyerere was creating a government based on democracy and socialism.","[change, travel, democracy]",government
23,Tony Blair,"I learnt a lot in government, and I've learnt a lot since leaving government. The kind of journey of being in government is that you start at your most popular and least capable, and you end at your most capable and least popular.","[journey, end, leaving]",government
24,Wanda Sykes,"The government shouldn't be involved in this because it's very simple. If you don't believe in same-sex marriage, then don't marry somebody of the same sex.","[marriage, simple, believe]",government
25,Bill O'Reilly,"The Tea Party is simply a loose description of local activism driven by Americans who want smaller government and more self-reliance. That sounds like what the Founding Fathers had in mind, does it not?","[mind, tea, party]",government
