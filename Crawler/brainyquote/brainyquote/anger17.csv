1,Henry B. Eyring,It is a lie that our anger justifies our impulse to hurt or ignore our antagonists. We are to forgive to be forgiven. To wait for them to repent before we forgive and repent is to allow them to choose for us a delay which could cost us happiness here and hereafter.,"[happiness, forgive, lie]",anger
2,Paul Ryan,"President Obama clearly cannot run on his record. All he's offering is more of the same. That's not good. Look at the economy. It's stagnating. And so, what they're now going to try and do is bring this campaign down to little things, distractions, distortions, smear, fear, anger, frustration.","[fear, good, little things]",anger
3,Richard M. Nixon,"What starts the process, really, are laughs and slights and snubs when you are a kid. If your anger is deep enough and strong enough, you learn that you can change those attitudes by excellence, personal gut performance.","[change, deep, strong]",anger

5,Gerry Cooney,"Boxing was a way to express my anger. All of a sudden, I was expressing anger, and I was good at it. I was like a Jekyll and Hyde. Boxing helped me because I was fighting the anger out. I was knocking guys out.","[good, me, fighting]",anger
6,Gerry Cooney,Boxing gave me a voice to express the anger I felt for where I came from.,"[voice, me, boxing]",anger
7,Albert Brooks,"All improv turns into anger. All comedy improv basically turns into anger, because that's all people know how to do when they're improvising. If you notice shows that are improvising are generally people yelling at each other.","[people, know, you]",anger
8,Albert Brooks,"I think anger and laughter are very close to each other, when you think about it.","[laughter, think, you]",anger
9,Albert Brooks,"I made my living in comedy, but I'm not a silly person. I've got all these sides to me. Even in my movies that I've written myself, the characters sometimes border on great anger or nutsiness or other kinds of behavior. I'm not just doing fart jokes for two hours.","[myself, great, me]",anger
10,Albert Brooks,"Even in my comedies, I don't take anger as a joke. I think anger and laughter are very close to each other, when you think about it. One of the things I like about a character: I always think it's fascinating when a character can turn on a dime and go from one emotion to another. I like watching that.","[laughter, character, think]",anger
11,Ellie Goulding,"It's usually a big kind of vent of frustration or anger or sadness that puts me in the right frame of mind to write. It's such a cliche to say that artists write when they're down, but it's true for me. It's a relief to get out what's eating away at my heart or my soul or my head.","[heart, mind, soul]",anger

15,John McAfee,An angry people cannot create anything that is not imbued with anger.,"[people, angry, create]",anger
16,John McAfee,"Governments are composed of human beings, and all of the frailties that humans possess are absorbed into these governments and become active within these governments. Hatred, anger, jealousy, fear, greed, distrust and the whole host of afflictions that humans must bear, lurk just beneath the surface of civility displayed by 'government.'","[fear, jealousy, government]",anger

18,Maajid Nawaz,"I was filled with hate and anger. But during my trial, something decisive happened: Amnesty International adopted me as a prisoner of conscience, and it was an unbelievable feeling to know that there is someone fighting for you on the outside. Amnesty's 'soft' approach made me seriously consider alternatives to revenge.","[revenge, hate, me]",anger

21,Pete Hamill,"The most powerful force in American politics is not anger, it's nostalgia.","[politics, american, powerful]",anger
22,Julian Baggini,"Anger clearly has its proper place at work, which is neither wholly absent nor ever present.
