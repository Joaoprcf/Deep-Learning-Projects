0,Jennifer Ellison,I don't find it a struggle to maintain a healthy diet now as my palate has changed. I don't crave rich food.,"[struggle, healthy, rich]",food
1,Diane Abbott,"When fast food is not a treat but a dietary staple, the children surf the internet all day in dark corners of the room and are bombarded with latest gadgets. Things replace parental standards.","[children, day, internet]",food
2,Mario Batali,"Unlike curing cancer or heart disease, we already know how to beat hunger: food.","[heart, know, hunger]",food
3,Mario Batali,"Working at the Food Bank with my kids is an eye-opener. The face of hunger isn't the bum on the street drinking Sterno; it's the working poor. They don't look any different, they don't behave any differently, they're not really any less educated. They are incredibly less privileged, and that's it.","[face, look, hunger]",food
4,Aarti Sequeira,The food in south India is the food that I really love because it reminds me of home.,"[love, home, me]",food
5,Aarti Sequeira,"I started cooking seven years ago for real, and I started with pasta, and lasagna and roast chicken. Very normal American dishes. When I turned on Food Network, or any sort of cooking channel, that's what people were making. So that's where your education comes from.","[education, cooking, people]",food
6,Jacques Pepin,"You can't escape the taste of the food you had as a child. In times of stress, what do you dream about? Your mother's clam chowder. It's security, comfort. It brings you home.","[home, mother, stress]",food
7,Jacques Pepin,"This June, I'll travel once again to the Food and Wine Magazine Classic in Aspen, Colorado. For many years, my dear friend Julia Child and I have teamed up to teach classes together at the event; for the past seven years, my daughter, Claudine, has been my cooking partner on stage.","[travel, cooking, together]",food
8,Cat Cora,"I think the biggest thing is clean as you go. Wash all your knives, cutting boards, dishes, when you are done cooking, not look at a sink full of dishes after you are done. Cleaning as you go helps keep away cross contamination and you avoid having food borne bacteria.","[cooking, look, think]",food
9,Cat Cora,"It's fun to pick a cuisine and say I'm going to research Ethiopian food, and see what it's all about. You find that there are a lot of similarities in cuisines from around the world and a lot of similar flavors.","[fun, research, world]",food
10,Curtis Stone,"For me, food is all about balance. If you eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, and an appropriate amount of poultry, fish, and red meat that are sourced from good places, you're doing well. It's important to make sure that the meat you're consuming is hormone-free.","[good, balance, fish]",food
11,Michael Symon,"Recipes are important but only to a point. What's more important than recipes is how we think about food, and a good cookbook should open up a new way of doing just that.","[good, doing, important]",food
12,Michael Symon,"I don't think any other holiday embraces the food of the Midwest quite like Thanksgiving. There's roasted meat and mashed potatoes. But being here is also about heritage. Cleveland is really a giant melting pot - not only is my family a melting pot, but so is the city.","[family, holiday]",food
13,Joel Robuchon,"The simpler the food, the harder it is to prepare it well. You want to truly taste what it is you're eating. So that goes back to the trend of fine ingredients. It's very Japanese: Preparing good ingredients very simply, without distractions from the flavor of the ingredient itself.","[good, want, eating]",food
14,Tyler Florence,"The concept of being a locavore, or one who chooses whenever possible to incorporate locally grown or locally produced food into one's nutrition plan, is of great importance.","[great, plan, possible]",food
15,Connie Britton,"I'm in an environment where I have a lot of information about how to stay healthy and live a good life. I love vegan and raw food, I love to exercise. If I weren't in this business, I think I would be aging differently.","[life, love, business]",food
16,Padma Lakshmi,"From the simple stringing together of lemon garlands for the goddess Durga, to dividing the prasadam or blessed foods for the children first, I came to associate food not only with feminity, but also with purity and divinity.","[children, together, blessed]",food
17,Colin Hay,"People say history is boring, and that is true because people are boring. We haven't changed since time began. We're still the same. We've obviously made some changes. When we started, it was all about food, clothing and shelter. Now we watch 'Top Chef', 'Project Runway', and 'Extreme Makeover: Home Edition.'","[time, home, history]",food
18,Bill O'Reilly,They advertise on the radio for food stamps!,"[radio, food stamps]",food
19,Ice Cube,"I'm trying to cut down a little on eating, on sodium, keep my blood pressure down, which is tough. Because I love food! I do, but it's unfair how everything that's bad for you tastes so good, and all the good stuff, veggies and green things, doesn't match up.","[love, good, trying]",food
20,Todd Akin,"Now an embryo may seem like some scientific or laboratory term, but in fact the embryo contains the unique information that defines a person. All you add is food and climate control, and some time, and the embryo becomes you or me.","[time, unique, control]",food
21,Zac Posen,"Food is everything. Food, friends, family: Those are the most important things in life.","[life, family, friends]",food
22,Jillian Michaels,"I only eat healthy food, and I only want healthy love!","[love, healthy, want]",food
23,Ezra Miller,"It makes sense that we came up with our public school system during the Industrial Revolution because it's like everybody is a factory worker, eating their terrible food and going back to the room where you're silent and listening to an idiot. That's an epitomizing idea, getting called 'Nothing' for your whole high school experience.","[experience, school]",food
24,Ezra Miller,"Doing things like playing music, something that's so natural and basic to human function, running around in nature, eating delicious food. These things are intrinsic in basic, primordial to human beings, so that's sort of a way to return to a blank canvas, allowing my true personality to return.","[music, nature, personality]",food
25,Gail Simmons,"I'm tempted by everything. My husband makes fun of me because every day it's a new food that I love. I have a weakness for butterscotch pudding, ice cream in any flavor and dark chocolate, although that's one thing I do keep in my house - 70% dark chocolate.","[love, day, fun]",food
