1,Madonna Ciccone,"Sometimes you want to go for a walk and you don't want to be watched. You just want to be anonymous and blend in. Especially when I travel, I feel that way, because I can't really go out and see a city the way other people can and I miss out on a lot.","[people, walk, city]",travel
2,Pharrell Williams,My ideal travel companions are my family.,"[family, ideal, companions]",travel
3,Katherine Jenkins,"In Heaven, I believe my dad is somewhere doing something nice. I feel I've been too lucky to travel this far without somebody guiding me.","[dad, believe, me]",travel
4,Izabel Goulart,Modeling has given me the opportunity to travel outside of Brazil and see the world. I have been meeting many interesting and talented people along the way.,"[opportunity, world, people]",travel
5,Soulja Boy,I don't travel anywhere without the PS3 and XBox. There's nothing better to do on long bus trips while on tour.,"[nothing, better, long]",travel
6,Lynn Margulis,"There is no scientific reason to think that we, even with space travel, are going to survive as a species for ever, certainly not by biting off the hand that feeds us, which is exactly what we are doing.","[space, doing, think]",travel
7,Andrew Weil,"Each day as I travel through downtown Tucson, I am amazed at how quickly the most ancient of human behaviors have changed. For as long as there have been Homo sapiens - roughly 200,000 years - people have filled their lives principally with two activities: talking directly with other people, and doing physical things.","[day, i am, people]",travel
8,Tim Cahill,"I have no problem with the adventure travel movement. It makes better, more sensitive people. If you get people diving on a coral reef, they're going to become more respectful of the outdoors and more concerned with the threats that places like that face and they're going to care more about protecting them than they would have before.","[adventure, people, problem]",travel
9,Timothy Ferriss,"You don't have to travel, but I find extended travel to be a helpful tool for reexamining yourself and the constraints you've artificially placed on your life. It's easy to believe everything has to be done one way if you're always in one place around the same people.","[life, believe, yourself]",travel
10,Tom Freston,"Travel early and travel often. Live abroad, if you can. Understand cultures other than your own. As your understanding of other cultures increases, your understanding of yourself and your own culture will increase exponentially.","[culture, yourself, live]",travel
11,Kevin Systrom,I actually think some of my best moments in life have been while I was with people from Instagram - whether it's super late nights getting a release out or being able to travel to places I'd never visited and meeting some of the most interesting people I've ever met.,"[life, best, people]",travel
12,Jake Shears,"I travel so much and am always living out of a suitcase, so my favorite saying is 'Wherever you go, there you are'. I love it because it's reassuring to me that you have to live in the moment wherever you happen to be.","[love, moment, me]",travel
13,Rob Machado,I think I'm one of the most fortunate people in the world. I travel around looking for the best waves and appreciate it every second.,"[best, world, people]",travel
14,Ben Parr,"With every inch of land on Earth now catalogued by our satellites, the stars are the next place we as a species must travel. And with a booming world population that will hit 9.1 billion in 2050, large-scale space travel may become a necessity.","[stars, world, earth]",travel
15,Nathan Myhrvold,"One of the things that I love to do is travel around the world and look at archaeological sites. Because archaeology gives us an opportunity to study past civilizations, and see where they succeeded and where they failed. Use science to, you know, work backwards and say, 'Well, really, what were they thinking?'","[love, work, science]",travel
16,JR,"The fact that I stay anonymous means I can exhibit wherever I want. No one knows my name, so it's easy for me to travel.","[me, easy, want]",travel
17,Wen Jiabao,"There are two books that I often travel with; one is 'The Theory on Moral Sentiments' by Adam Smith. The other is 'The Meditations.' It's not that I agree with either views expressed in the books, but I believe ideas and thoughts of older generations can offer food for thought for the current generation.","[food, believe, generation]",travel
18,Lisa Ling,The best education I have ever received was through travel.,"[education, best, through]",travel
19,Lisa Ling,I hope my desire to travel so much isn't forever because it's not the most conducive lifestyle for a relationship or a family by any means.,"[family, relationship, hope]",travel
20,Bonnie Raitt,"In 1967 I entered Harvard as a freshman, confident - in the way that only 17-year-olds are - that I could change the world. My major was African Studies, and my plan was to travel to Tanzania, where President Julius Nyerere was creating a government based on democracy and socialism.","[change, democracy]",travel
21,William Shatner,"I find the whole time travel question very unsettling if you take it to its logical extension. I think it might eventually be possible, but then what happens?","[time, find, think]",travel
22,Eden Sher,I mostly like to travel and volunteer because I get antsy if I stay in my comfort zone for too long.,"[comfort zone, volunteer]",travel
23,Kelly Wearstler,"I love to travel and to be inspired by new things, so everything is always new. I've never done the same bathroom or the same kitchen a second time. It's challenging, and I like to be challenged.","[love, time, new things]",travel
24,Melissa Rivers,"I'm a big fan of the laceless Converse for travel, with cute jeans, and throw on a little jacket, and you look presentable.","[cute, look, you]",travel
25,Norman Foster,"I travel continuously, and I see many cities, but there is nowhere like London.","[london, see, many]",travel
