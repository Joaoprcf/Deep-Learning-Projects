5,Sylvester Stallone,People that spend time in a foxhole - they're never going to find that relationship anywhere else again... Everything else pales next to that.

6,Yoko Ono,"I think there is a big difference between the music business and music. And my relationship is to music, not music business. I think the business will keep changing, but music won't. Music will be there.","[music, business, think]",relationship

15,Dinesh D'Souza,"If Obama came by his liberalism in the faculty lounge, then sure, he can see it hasn't worked, and he can modify it.

20,Robert Zoellick,The Congress has had an uneasy relationship with banks and bankers since Alexander Hamilton. It took the United States until 1913 to set up a central bank. The Federal Reserve earned its hard-won independence over years of effort.,"[effort, independence]",relationship
21,Jeffrey Brown,"I always try to write from memory, and I always try to use memory as an editor. So when I'm thinking of something like a relationship or whatever, then I'm letting my memory tell me what the important things were.","[memory, thinking, me]",relationship

24,Dan Bartlett,"Without the media, the American people won't have the type of information they need to hold their leaders to account.
