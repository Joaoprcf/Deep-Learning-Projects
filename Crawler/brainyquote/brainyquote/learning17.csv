1,Don Everly,"Dad wouldn't let me fool with his guitar much, because I'm left-handed, and I'd pick it up upside down.

12,Jeb Bush,"Public education must be viewed from the lens of providing each child with the learning environment that best meets his or her needs.

It took a while to adjust to living there and learning the language, but now I have lots of friends. I get the best of two completely different worlds.","[best, history, language]",learning
19,Lydia Leonard,"Professionally, I was at Bristol Old Vic Theatre School and did lots of things there, and then I won the BBC Carlton Hobbs Award, so I did some BBC Radio drama work, which is a lovely way to start out because you work with lots of great people, and you're working all the time, so you're learning rather than sitting around and waitressing.","[work, time, great]",learning
20,Caroll Spinney,"When he first started - Jim Henson, who created Bid Bird and Oscar - he said Big Bird was just a big, goofy guy. And it was - a script came along and I said, 'I think Big Bird would be much more useful to the show if he were a child learning all the things we were teaching in the show.' And so he didn't know the alphabet, even, for instance.","[bird, child, know]",learning
21,Nalo Hopkinson,"It's the thing I struggle with every day: the mental diligence and stamina needed to sit in front of the computer, open the file, start writing and to keep doing so, word after word, until I've created the next story.
