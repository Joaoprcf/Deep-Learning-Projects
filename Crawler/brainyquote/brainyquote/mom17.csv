0,Josh Peck,"I do work too hard sometimes, but my mom is such an inspiration. She tells me to 'chill out' and not take things so seriously. She will say: 'Go and have a massage.'","[work, me, she]",mom
1,Amandla Stenberg,My mom reminds me that all things are possible.,"[me, possible, things]",mom
2,Steve Carell,Sending a handwritten letter is becoming such an anomaly. It's disappearing. My mom is the only one who still writes me letters. And there's something visceral about opening a letter - I see her on the page. I see her in her handwriting.,"[me, page, opening]",mom
3,Aaron Douglas,"My mom says that when I was a little kid, I always used to say I wanted to be an actor, but I don't remember that.","[remember, actor, say]",mom
4,Ksenia Solo,"My mom is actually a former prima ballerina, and all the women in my family are associated either with dance or choreography or acting, so I'm very lucky in a way because I grew up in a family of artists. I've been dancing since I was a little kid.","[family, women, dance]",mom
5,Kathryn Erbe,"Being on a major network television show is like long-distance running: You have to pace yourself and maintain your energy level and your morale. There's the role you're playing on the show, and there's also your behind-the-scenes responsibility to the crew, the guest actors and the fans - not to mention your own life as a mom.","[life, responsibility]",mom
6,James Patterson,"I always figured there would be a kid audience and an adult audience, and there is. That's true for 'Hunger Games' and 'Twilight' and 'Harry Potter.' And 'Maximum Ride,' for sure. In particular what happens is a lot of parents share the books with their kids, and the mom has read it, and the kids, and they talk about it.","[parents, ride, true]",mom
7,Emma Stone,"I had massive anxiety as a child. I was in therapy. From 8 to 10, I was borderline agora-phobic. I could not leave my mom's side. I don't really have panic attacks anymore, but I had really bad anxiety.","[child, anxiety, bad]",mom
8,Kirsten Dunst,A lot of moms give their kids line reads. My mom wasn't put in that position because I always had an acting teacher helping with the feelings rather than how to say something.,"[teacher, acting, something]",mom

10,Liya Kebede,"The most inspiring piece of advice I've gotten is simply to persevere. My mom taught me to always keep going no matter what from an early age. When it feels too difficult to push forward, I always remind myself, 'This too shall pass,' and then I redouble my efforts.","[age, myself, keep going]",mom
11,Clinton Sparks,"A lot of times when people become successful, people don't really understand what they had to do or the sacrifices they made to do that, or they assume that they had money. This is coming from, like, a kid who was broke and lived with roaches and a single mom in Dorchester.","[money, people, successful]",mom
12,Ben Affleck,"I got into acting as a young child on account of a sort of arbitrary thing. A friend of my mom's was a casting director, so really, as kind of a lark, I had a couple of acting jobs that had just enough exposure to give me the option to continue if I wanted to. I followed through with it.","[me, child, friend]",mom
13,Jesse Plemons,"I was 3 and a half, and there was an open call for a Coca-Cola commercial. We were living around Dallas, and my mom took me. I think they were calling for 16-year-olds that could ride horses and swing a rope, and for whatever reason, my mom took me up there when I was 3. But I always had a rope, and I was a little cowboy at that age.","[age, me, living]",mom

15,Stephanie Szostak,"My dad's American, and my mom's French. I lived in France for the first 18 years of my life, then came here to go to school at the College of William and Mary. I studied marketing. I really didn't know what I wanted to do, so I thought that's what I should do - study business - because it would give me the best chance to find work.","[life, best, work]",mom
16,Joe Biden,"When my first semester grades came out, my mom and dad told me I wouldn't be playing football.","[dad, football, me]",mom
17,Michael Keaton,"I read that John Hughes script for 'Mr. Mom,' and I thought, 'This guy is a funny writer.' I went: 'You ought to stick around and direct this thing.' But he didn't; he left, and look what he became. A really legendary comedy director.","[funny, thought, look]",mom
18,"Robert Downey, Jr.","Dad's Jewish and Irish, Mom's German and Scotch. I couldn't say I was anything. My last name isn't even Downey. My dad changed his name when he wanted to get into the Army and was underage. My real name is Robert Elias. I feel like I'm still looking for a home in some way.","[home, dad, looking]",mom
19,Bryce Dallas Howard,"While 'The Help' is in so many ways a celebration of these women's friendships and what they overcome, it's also very truthful and very painful, and it was intense for my mom to read that.","[women, help, celebration]",mom
20,Melania Trump,"A lot of people say I am using all the procedures for my face. I didn't do anything. I live a healthy life; I take care of my skin and my body. I'm against Botox. I'm against injections; I think it's damaging your face, damaging your nerves. It's all me. I will age gracefully, as my mom does.","[life, age, i am]",mom
21,Sunil Yapa,"I remember so clearly from when I was five years old, my mom and dad arguing over - not over whether it was better, but whether it was proper or whether it was correct to eat with a fork or to eat with your hands, like we do in Sri Lanka. Proper. Like, what is the correct way to eat?","[dad, hands, remember]",mom
22,Dwayne Johnson,"My mom cleaned toilets for a long time, and she'd seen a lot of terrible things, but she was still the strength of our family. And there are women like that all across the country - all around the world - who show that type of fortitude.","[family, time, strength]",mom
23,Robin Wright,"My mother gave me a sense of independence, a sense of total confidence that we could do whatever it was we set out to do. That's how we were raised.","[confidence, mother]",mom
24,Mike Krzyzewski,"The person who has inspired me my whole life is my Mom, because she taught me commitment. She sacrificed.","[life, commitment, me]",mom
25,Lance Loud,"For the naysayers that claimed 'American Family' revealed us to be vacant, unloving, uncaring morons of the materialistic '70s, this image will be proven wrong when Mom and Dad remarry... Make no mistake. This is not to emphasize the sadness of my demise but rather emphasize the love of my family and friends.","[love, family, dad]",mom
