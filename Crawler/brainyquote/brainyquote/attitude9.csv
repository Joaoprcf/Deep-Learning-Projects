1,Joyce Meyer,"I'm only going to stand before God and give an account for my life, not for somebody else's life. If I have a bad attitude, then I need to say there's no point in me blaming you for what's wrong in my life.","[life, god, me]",attitude
2,Christopher Isherwood,"What irritates me is the bland way people go around saying, 'Oh, our attitude has changed. We don't dislike these people any more.' But by the strangest coincidence, they haven't taken away the injustice; the laws are still on the books.","[injustice, people, me]",attitude
3,Ivan Illich,"The compulsion to do good is an innate American trait.

Ultimately this attitude leads to bombing people into the acceptance of gifts.","[good, believe, blessings]",attitude
4,Mark Spitz,"The pool is terrible, but that doesn't have much to do with my record swims. That's all mental attitude.","[mental, much, terrible]",attitude

6,Lascelles Abercrombie,"Epic poetry exhibits life in some great symbolic attitude. It cannot strictly be said to symbolize life itself, but always some manner of life.","[life, poetry, great]",attitude
7,Clara Zetkin,"In individual industries where female labour pays an important role, any movement advocating better wages, shorter working hours, etc., would not be doomed from the start because of the attitude of those women workers who are not organized.","[women, start, important]",attitude
8,Christopher Hitchens,"When I go to the clinic next and sit with a tube in my arm and watch the poison go in, I'm in an attitude of abject passivity. It doesn't feel like fighting at all; it just feels like submitting.","[fighting, feel, poison]",attitude

11,Salman Khan,"People are patronizing the theatres with renewed enthusiasm - there is an entire picnic-like attitude when families go out to see movies, which is a very good sign.

16,Joyce Meyer,"I want to look my best for God. So many people have the attitude that if you're a Christian you've got to dress bad, wear an old color, not do anything to your hair, have nothing. It's no wonder that Christianity is not very attractive. I mean, how many people do you know in a Western culture that's going to go, 'Yeah, give me some of that?'","[best, god, culture]",attitude
17,Elmore Leonard,"When you are developing your style, you avoid weaknesses. I am not good at describing things, so I stay away from it.

18,Mary J. Blige,"I didn't know how to show my self love, and I didn't want anyone else to hurt me. So my tough girl attitude was like, 'I'm not having it.'","[love, self, girl]",attitude
19,Tony Stewart,"I go into it with the attitude that I'm not going to look at my leg, and as soon as they get the wrapping off of it, I'm like, 'I've got to look.'

21,David Sanborn,"In regard to music, I just think that it's always best to have an attitude of being a perpetual student and always look to learn something new about music, because there's always something new to learn.

22,Esther Rolle,"'Hollywood maids' are so idiotic. They grin at everything. I told Norman Lear I didn't want to play a maid because of that 'hee-hee/grin-grin' attitude, and he said, 'Who said I wanted that?'

23,Evel Knievel,"I like to help kids, work with kids in detention homes. Don't tell a kid what's right and wrong. He knows what's right and wrong. Find out what his attitude and his aptitude are; try to help him where he wants to go.","[work, help, find]",attitude
24,Eddie Vedder,"I think music is the greatest art form that exists, and I think people listen to music for different reasons, and it serves different purposes.

The best songs are the ones that make you feel something.","[life, change, music]",attitude
25,David Byrne,Punk was defined by an attitude rather than a musical style.,"[style, punk, rather]",attitude
