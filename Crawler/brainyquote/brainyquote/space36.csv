0,Steve Jobs,"The people who are doing the work are the moving force behind the Macintosh. My job is to create a space for them, to clear out the rest of the organization and keep it at bay.","[work, job, moving]",space
1,Stephen Hawking,"I don't think the human race will survive the next thousand years, unless we spread into space.","[think, race, survive]",space
2,Stephen Hawking,I think the human race doesn't have a future if it doesn't go into space.,"[future, think, race]",space
3,Stephen Hawking,"Before 1915, space and time were thought of as a fixed arena in which events took place, but which was not affected by what happened in it. Space and time are now dynamic quantities... space and time not only affect but are also affected by everything that happens in the universe.","[time, universe, thought]",space
4,Stephen Hawking,Perhaps one day I will go into space.,"[day, one day, will]",space
5,Stephen Hawking,"I have wanted to fly into space for many years, but never imagined it would really be feasible.","[fly, many, never]",space
6,Stephen Hawking,"If we want to travel into the future, we just need to go fast. Really fast. And I think the only way we're ever likely to do that is by going into space.","[travel, future, want]",space
7,Joseph B. Wirthlin,"The light from the sun breaks through space, bathing our planet as it encircles the sun with life-giving warmth and light. Without the sun, there could be no life on this planet; it would be forever barren, cold, and dark.","[life, light, sun]",space
8,John F. Kennedy,I am sorry to say that there is too much point to the wisecrack that life is extinct on other planets because their scientists were more advanced than ours.,"[life, i am, sorry]",space
9,John F. Kennedy,America has tossed its cap over the wall of space.,"[america, over, cap]",space
10,John F. Kennedy,"Why should man's first flight to the moon be a matter of national competition? Why should the United States and the Soviet Union, in preparing for such expeditions, become involved in immense duplications of research, construction and expenditure?","[moon, man, competition]",space
11,Elon Musk,"Land on Mars, a round-trip ticket - half a million dollars. It can be done.","[mars, done, land]",space
12,Elon Musk,"If we drive down the cost of transportation in space, we can do great things.","[great, down, transportation]",space
13,Seth Shostak,"The stars look the same from night to night. Nebulae and galaxies are dully immutable, maintaining the same overall appearance for thousands or millions of years. Indeed, only the sun, moon and planets - together with the occasional comet, asteroid or meteor - seem dynamic.","[stars, together, moon]",space
14,Seth Shostak,"In the four years since its launch, Kepler has chalked up 122 new and confirmed planets. It's also caught the scent of nearly three thousand additional objects, of which probably 80 percent or more will turn out to be other-worldly orbs.","[launch, three, turn]",space
15,Seth Shostak,"The math is dead simple: it seems that the frequency of planets able to support life is roughly one percent. In other words, a billion or more such worlds exist in our galaxy alone. That's a lot of acreage, and it takes industrial-strength credulity to believe it's all bleakly barren.","[life, alone, simple]",space
16,Seth Shostak,"Each year, thousands of UFOs are sighted and reported, which is an impressive tally of unidentified aerial phenomena. Surveys show that roughly one-third of the populace believes that at least some of this sky show is due to extraterrestrial spacecraft, here to probe our airspace and, when that proves boring, our bodies.","[sky, year, boring]",space
17,Peter Diamandis,My childhood dreams were focused on being part of the effort to make humanity a multiplanetary species.,"[dreams, humanity, effort]",space
18,Craig Venter,"I am absolutely certain that life can exist in outer space, move around, find a new aqueous environment.","[life, i am, environment]",space
19,Craig Venter,The day is not far off when we will be able to send a robotically controlled genome-sequencing unit in a probe to other planets to read the DNA sequence of any alien microbe life that may be there.,"[life, day, alien]",space
20,Lyndon B. Johnson,The moon and other celestial bodies should be free for exploration and use by all countries. No country should be permitted to advance a claim of sovereignty.,"[moon, free, country]",space
21,George W. Bush,"We will build new ships to carry man forward into the universe, to gain a new foothold on the moon and to prepare for new journeys to the worlds beyond our own.","[moon, man, universe]",space
22,Eric Hoffer,"Our passionate preoccupation with the sky, the stars, and a God somewhere in outer space is a homing impulse. We are drawn back to where we came from.","[god, stars, sky]",space
23,Vint Cerf,There is a project that's underway called the interplanetary Internet. It's in operation between Earth and Mars. It's operating on the International Space Station. It's part of the spacecraft that's in orbit around the Sun that's rendezvoused with two planets.,"[sun, internet, earth]",space
24,Isaac Newton,"The motions of the comets are exceedingly regular, and they observe the same laws as the motions of the planets, but they differ from the motions of vortices in every particular and are often contrary to them.","[same, laws, every]",space
25,Michio Kaku,"Our astronauts, when they go orbiting around the earth, they actually come back slightly younger than a twin that they would have on the planet Earth who was stationary. This is called the twin paradox.","[earth, paradox, planet]",space
