0,Paul Davies,"Traditionally, scientists have treated the laws of physics as simply 'given,' elegant mathematical relationships that were somehow imprinted on the universe at its birth, and fixed thereafter. Inquiry into the origin and nature of the laws was not regarded as a proper part of science.","[nature, universe, birth]",science
1,Rupert Sheldrake,I went through the standard scientific atheist phase when I was about 14. I bought into that package deal of science equals atheism.,"[atheist, through, phase]",science
2,Rupert Sheldrake,"For more than 200 years, materialists have promised that science will eventually explain everything in terms of physics and chemistry. Believers are sustained by the faith that scientific discoveries will justify their beliefs.","[faith, beliefs, chemistry]",science
3,James Hansen,What has become clear from the science is that we cannot burn all of the fossil fuels without creating a very different planet.,"[burn, planet, fossil fuels]",science
4,Sam Harris,I don't think there's an interesting boundary between philosophy and science. Science is totally beholden to philosophy. There are philosophical assumptions in science and there's no way to get around that.,"[philosophy, think, way]",science
5,Richard K. Morgan,"Science casts a long black shadow back over who we think we are, and where it falls the temperature falls with it. Its touch is chilly and unforgiving.","[black, shadow, think]",science
6,Samuel R. Delany,"Science fiction isn't just thinking about the world out there. It's also thinking about how that world might be - a particularly important exercise for those who are oppressed, because if they're going to change the world we live in, they - and all of us - have to be able to think about a world that works differently.","[change, change the world]",science
7,John Barrowman,"You know, every year 'Torchwood' has become something a little different than it was before. It's still sci-fi, but it doesn't just deal with spaceships and aliens all the time, because we've done that. Our science fiction is more psychological.","[time, year, know]",science
8,Chuck Berry,"Science and religion are both the same thing. They're there; they're life. If it's not science, it's not a fact.","[life, religion, same]",science
9,Mahmoud Ahmadinejad,One can not impede scientific progress.,"[progress, scientific]",science
10,Megan Smith,"We need to have making, including computer science, shop, etc. as part of the core curriculum from the beginning, not just an optional afterschool thing. Things like First Robotics and all of those great programs need to become mainstream.","[great, beginning]",science
11,Ralph Waldo Emerson,Bad times have a scientific value. These are occasions a good learner would not miss.,"[good, value, bad]",science
12,Alvin Toffler,The next major explosion is going to be when genetics and computers come together. I'm talking about an organic computer - about biological substances that can function like a semiconductor.,"[together, computers, talking]",science
13,Jacques Yves Cousteau,"I am not a scientist. I am, rather, an impresario of scientists.","[i am, rather, scientists]",science
14,Thomas Huxley,"Science is simply common sense at its best, that is, rigidly accurate in observation, and merciless to fallacy in logic.","[best, logic, observation]",science
15,Will Harvey,What is research but a blind date with knowledge?,"[knowledge, research, blind]",science
16,Roger Bacon,"All science requires mathematics. The knowledge of mathematical things is almost innate in us. This is the easiest of sciences, a fact which is obvious in that no one's brain rejects it; for laymen and people who are utterly illiterate know how to count and reckon.","[knowledge, mathematics]",science
17,Elon Musk,"You could warm Mars up, over time, with greenhouse gases.","[time, warm, mars]",science
18,Albert Einstein,It stands to the everlasting credit of science that by acting on the human mind it has overcome man's insecurity before himself and before nature.,"[nature, mind, man]",science
19,Stephen Hawking,"If you believe in science, like I do, you believe that there are certain laws that are always obeyed.","[believe, you, always]",science
20,Stephen Hawking,I believe there are no questions that science can't answer about a physical universe.,"[believe, universe, questions]",science
21,John F. Kennedy,"Let both sides seek to invoke the wonders of science instead of its terrors. Together let us explore the stars, conquer the deserts, eradicate disease, tap the ocean depths, and encourage the arts and commerce.","[stars, together, ocean]",science
22,Elon Musk,Mars is the only place in the solar system where it's possible for life to become multi-planetarian.,"[life, mars, place]",science
23,Elon Musk,Rockets are cool. There's no getting around that.,"[cool, rockets, getting]",science
24,Buzz Aldrin,"Mars has been flown by, orbited, smacked into, radar inspected, and rocketed onto, as well as bounced upon, rolled over, shoveled, drilled into, baked, and even laser blasted.","[mars, over, laser]",science
25,Robert Green Ingersoll,"Reason, observation, and experience; the holy trinity of science.","[experience, observation]",science
