0,Daniel H. Pink,The ability to take another perspective has become one of the keys to both sales and non-sales selling. And the social science research on perspective-taking yields some important lessons for all of us.,"[perspective, research, sales]",science
1,Masi Oka,"I've been programming computers since elementary school, where they taught us, and I stuck with computer science through high school and college.","[college, school, computers]",science
2,Samuel R. Delany,"Linguistics is very much a science. It's a human science, one of the human sciences. And it's one of the more interesting human sciences.","[interesting, human, much]",science
3,Henry Mintzberg,"I describe management as arts, crafts and science. It is a practice that draws on arts, craft and science and there is a lot of craft - meaning experience - there is a certain amount of craft meaning insight, creativity and vision, and there is the use of science, technique or analysis.","[experience, creativity]",science
4,Linus Pauling,"Science is the search for truth, that is the effort to understand the world: it involves the rejection of bias, of dogma, of revelation, but not the rejection of morality.","[truth, effort, world]",science
5,Peter M. Brant,"Art and science have so much in common - the process of trial and error, finding something new and innovative, and to experiment and succeed in a breakthrough.","[art, finding, succeed]",science
6,Bill Nye,"It's important that our children are raised to be educated, well-rounded tax-paying citizens that understand the importance of technology and science.","[technology, children]",science
7,James Murdoch,"Through basic science literacy, people can understand the policy choices we need to be making. Scientists are not necessarily the greatest communicators, but science and communication is one of the fundamentals we need to address. People are interested.","[communication, greatest]",science
8,Paul Johnson,"Marxism, Freudianism, global warming. These are proof - of which history offers so many examples - that people can be suckers on a grand scale. To their fanatical followers they are a substitute for religion. Global warming, in particular, is a creed, a faith, a dogma that has little to do with science.","[history, faith, religion]",science
9,Francis Collins,"I'm enormously interested to see where neuroscience can take us in understanding these complexities of the human brain and how it works, but I do think there may be limits in terms of what science can tell us about what does good and evil mean anyway, and what are those concepts about?","[good, evil, good and evil]",science
10,Janine Benyus,"Biologically inspired materials could revolutionize materials science. People looking at spider silk and abalone shells are looking for new ways to make materials better, cheaper, and with less toxic byproducts.","[people, looking, better]",science
11,Randy Alcorn,"It's not just what Christian fiction lacks I appreciate - it's what it offers. The variety is vast: contemporary, historical, suspense, mysteries, adventure, young adult, romance, fantasy, science fiction.","[adventure, appreciate]",science
12,Michio Kaku,"In science, nothing is ever 100% proven.","[nothing, ever, proven]",science
13,Michio Kaku,"No one knows who wrote the laws of physics or where they come from. Science is based on testable, reproducible evidence, and so far we cannot test the universe before the Big Bang.","[universe, test, physics]",science
14,Neill Blomkamp,"There's no question that how Johannesburg operates is what made me interested in the idea of wealth discrepancy. 'Elysium' could be a metaphor for just Jo'burg, but it's also a metaphor for the Third World and the First World. And in science fiction, separation of wealth is a really interesting idea to mess with.","[world, wealth, me]",science
15,Padmasree Warrior,"There is an outdated belief that girls are not as good at science and math subjects as boys. But according to the report 'Generation STEM,' high school girls earn more math and science credits than boys do, and their GPAs, aggregated across math and science classes, are higher than boys'.","[good, school, generation]",science
16,Sandra Bullock,"No one has proof that I know of, that a higher power exists, yet a major portion of the world believes in it and relies on it in faith in trust, in what that is. Where is the science in that? And yet you have incredible belief in that.","[trust, faith, power]",science
17,Jose Saramago,"I think the novel is not so much a literary genre, but a literary space, like a sea that is filled by many rivers. The novel receives streams of science, philosophy, poetry and contains all of these; it's not simply telling a story.","[poetry, sea, philosophy]",science
18,Greg Graffin,Science is very vibrant. There are always new observations to be found. And it's all in the interest in challenging the authority that came before you. That's consistent with the punk rock ethos that suggests that you should not take what people say at face value.,"[people, value, face]",science
19,Linus Torvalds,"I often compare open source to science. To where science took this whole notion of developing ideas in the open and improving on other peoples' ideas and making it into what science is today and the incredible advances that we have had. And I compare that to witchcraft and alchemy, where openness was something you didn't do.","[today, ideas, improving]",science
20,Michael Shermer,Mysteries once thought to be supernatural or paranormal happenings - such as astronomical or meteorological events - are incorporated into science once their causes are understood.,"[thought, paranormal, events]",science
21,Dean Kamen,"Sporting competitions seem to be what we obsess over, frankly. So if we can put engineering, science, technology into a format of healthy, fun competition, we can attract all sorts of kids that might not see the kind of activity we do as accessible or rewarding.","[technology, competition, fun]",science
22,Eliezer Yudkowsky,"Nothing you'll read as breaking news will ever hold a candle to the sheer beauty of settled science. Textbook science has carefully phrased explanations for new students, math derived step by step, plenty of experiments as illustration, and test problems.","[beauty, candle, problems]",science
23,Nikola Tesla,"Electrical science has revealed to us the true nature of light, has provided us with innumerable appliances and instruments of precision, and has thereby vastly added to the exactness of our knowledge.","[nature, knowledge, light]",science
24,Alan Alda,"Marie Curie is my hero. Few people have accomplished something so rare - changing science. And as hard as that is, she had to do it against the tide of the culture at the time - the prejudice against her as a foreigner, because she was born in Poland and worked in France. And the prejudice against her as a woman.","[time, hero, culture]",science
25,Neil deGrasse Tyson,I'm often asked by parents what advice can I give them to help get kids interested in science? And I have only one bit of advice. Get out of their way. Kids are born curious. Period.,"[parents, help, advice]",science
