0,Satya Nadella,"India for sure is a mobile-first country. But I don't think it will be a mobile-only country for all time. An emerging market will have more computing in their lives, not less computing, as there is more GDP and there is more need. As they grow, they will also want computers that grow from their phone.","[time, grow, want]",computers

7,Douglas Adams,Computers are still technology because we are still wrestling with it: it's still being invented; we're still trying to work out how it works. There's a world of game interaction to come that you or I wouldn't recognise. It's time for the machines to disappear. The computer's got to disappear into all of the things we use.,"[work, time, technology]",computers
8,Douglas Adams,"Ever since Newton, we've done science by taking things apart to see how they work. What the computer enables us to do is to put things together to see how they work: we're now synthesized rather than analysed. I find one of the most enthralling aspects of computers is limitless communication.","[work, communication, science]",computers

12,Mother Angelica,We resemble computers intellectually and animals emotionally.,"[animals, intellectually]",computers

14,David Lynch,"More and more people are seeing the films on computers - lousy sound, lousy picture - and they think they've seen the film, but they really haven't.","[people, think, picture]",computers
15,Wendy Kopp,The idea that computers can ever replace teachers and schools reveals a deep lack of understanding about the role leadership plays in student success.,"[success, leadership, deep]",computers
16,Cary Fukunaga,"I think the only reason people use PCs is because they have to. Mac is the most streamlined computer there is. I started using the Mac in college because I was doing editing, and they were the only computers we could use to do that.","[college, people, doing]",computers
17,Katie Taylor,"People need to get out and do some more exercise, especially children who are stuck inside with computers.","[children, people, exercise]",computers
18,Letitia Baldrige,"At home, we're listening to TV or playing with our computers, so our entertaining is rusting. We don't know how to be good hosts and guests in business situations.","[home, business, good]",computers
19,Ruth Reichl,"The way we live is changing. Each year, our free time shrinks a little more as computers clamor for an increasing percentage of our attention.","[time, year, attention]",computers
20,Marvin Ammori,"In the early 1990s, Americans used their home phone lines to connect their desktop computers to the Internet via ISPs like AOL, Earthlink, or Netzero. Back then, the ISPs didn't have cost-effective technology to select particular sites for blocking or privileging.","[technology, home, internet]",computers
21,Terry Teachout,"In 2004, the iPod was a novelty, and tablet computers were a dream. Now we take for granted that we can see whatever we want whenever and wherever we want to see it, be it 'Grand Illusion' or 'Duck Dynasty.'","[take for granted, dream]",computers
22,Dylan Lauren,Computers intimidate me.,"[me, intimidate]",computers
23,Mitch Kapor,"Well, I had a lot of help from my father with the soldering and so on, and he was very good at math and was fascinated with computers, and so I was fortunate enough to have a bunch of exposure going all the way back to high school - this was in the 1960s.","[father, good, school]",computers
24,Will Self,The whole aesthetics of computers very much feeds into my OCD. They fill my head with obsessionalities and my actions become very repetitive. It seems quite inimical to the dreamy state out of which fiction comes which seems so much less causally repetitive than the way one works on computers.,"[fiction, way, head]",computers
25,Mitch Kapor,Computers ought to help people find their own best path through lots of textual information.,"[best, path, help]",computers
