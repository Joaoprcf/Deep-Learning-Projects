6,Julie Walters,"Sixty felt like a big landmark. Not in a dreadful sense, but none of the other birthdays have bothered me. It's got labels on it - OAP, retirement - and I just wanted to take stock.

7,Danica Patrick,"To be honest, when I'm home, every day is a Friday for me. It doesn't really matter what day it is for me.

11,David Mamet,"Here's what happens in a play. You get involved in a situation where something is unbalanced. If nothing's unbalanced, there's no reason to have a play. If Hamlet comes home from school, and his dad's not dead and asks him if he's had a good time, it's boring. But if something's unbalanced, it must be returned to order.","[time, good, dad]",home
12,Virginia Postrel,"Society needs both parents and nonparents, both the work party and the home party.

21,Hulk Hogan,"The coolest thing, and I have it at home, is a huge Hulk Hogan, normal-sized pinball machine. When people come over they play it for hours.

I think that's the coolest.","[time, brother, people]",home
