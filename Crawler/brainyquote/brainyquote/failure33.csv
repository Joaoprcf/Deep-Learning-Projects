0,Ranbir Kapoor,"I'm quite detached from failure and success. Once a shooting is done, I kind of close that chapter in my life.","[life, success, my life]",failure

2,Darin Strauss,The starkest rejection letter might be followed by a million-dollar advance. Don't let rejection start to look the same as failure.,"[rejection, start, look]",failure
3,Brooke Shields,"I would have thought that I would have become one of those parents - just because it's my nature to be such a perfectionist - that anything falling short, I would have seen as a failure. But something has happened to me over the past few years - it's not Zen, believe me, I'm not at all Zen - but I'm so appreciative of even the chaos.","[nature, past, parents]",failure
4,Daisaku Ikeda,"Ultimately, all human activities have as their goal the realization of happiness. Why, then, have we ended up producing the opposite result? Could the underlying cause be our failure to correctly understand the true nature of happiness?","[happiness, nature, goal]",failure

9,Audre Lorde,"The failure of academic feminists to recognize difference as a crucial strength is a failure to reach beyond the first patriarchal lesson. In our world, divide and conquer must become define and empower.","[strength, world, conquer]",failure
10,Sara Blakely,"I think failure is nothing more than life's way of nudging you that you are off course. My attitude to failure is not attached to outcome, but in not trying. It is liberating. Most people attach failure to something not working out or how people perceive you. This way, it is about answering to yourself.","[life, attitude, yourself]",failure
11,Ron Perlman,"I'm fully aware that things that resonate and become real hits are the exception to the rule, so much so that I've wired myself for failure.","[myself, real, things]",failure

13,Roger Daltrey,I don't think there's any way it could have failed. We don't know failure in this band. We didn't know failure. We got to know it a little after awhile but at that time there was no such word.,"[time, know, think]",failure
14,Anupam Kher,"One time I nearly experienced failure was when I was acting in 'Hum Aapke Hain Kaun' in 1994. One day, I woke up and found that part of my face was paralysed.","[time, day, face]",failure

21,Clayton M. Christensen,The dumb-manager theory of business problems just didn't hold water for me. There had to be a deeper reason why smart people would make decisions that lead to failure.,"[business, water, decisions]",failure
22,Eric Ries,"The attributes for entrepreneurs cut both ways. You need the ability to ignore inconvenient facts and see the world as it should be and not as it is.

The characteristics that help entrepreneurs succeed can also lead to their failure.","[faith, help, world]",failure
23,Eric Ries,"I can't say I'm not grateful to have journalists writing about me as a genius. But I know it's not true. I'm not confused. I understand that success comes through a lot of failure and a lot of very embarrassing failure. People want to create the next Facebook, but they are too afraid to create the next Facemash.","[success, grateful, writing]",failure
24,Eric Ries,"Our educational system is not preparing people for the 21st Century. Failure is an essential part of entrepreneurship. If you work hard, you can get an 'A' pretty much guaranteed, but in entrepreneurship, that's not how it works.","[work, work hard, people]",failure
25,Eric Ries,Start-ups make so many mistakes that the challenge to identify the root cause of a failure is tough. But believing in your own plan is probably the worst.,"[mistakes, challenge, plan]",failure
