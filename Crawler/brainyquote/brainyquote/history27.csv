4,Edmund White,"Few writers in history have ever been 'politically correct' (a notion that rapidly changes in any case), and there's no reason to imagine that gay writers will ever suit their readers, especially since that readership is splintered into ghettos within ghettos.","[gay, changes, reason]",history
5,Edmund White,"In a novel, I think you have a contract with the reader to make the character representative - of a moment in history, a social class... for instance, I wanted to make the boy in 'A Boy's Own Story' more like other gay men of my generation in their youth and not like me.","[character, men, youth]",history

14,Nayef Al-Rodhan,"The history of Israel-Palestine conflict cannot be understood without its underlying emotional meanders.

We, of the present, decide what to keep, what to put on display, what to put into storage, and what to discard.","[people, summer, student]",history
16,Zendaya,"My mother's proud of where she's from, and her history, and her past, and same with my dad. I have roots in Africa. Like, I am from Africa as well as from Germany, and I am very proud of that.","[dad, mother, past]",history

21,Krist Novoselic,"It felt like being in the center of the world, and I felt like I was a witness to history and I knew that the whole world was watching on television.

23,Jonathan Safran Foer,"Jews have a special relationship to books, and the Haggadah has been translated more widely, and reprinted more often, than any other Jewish book.
