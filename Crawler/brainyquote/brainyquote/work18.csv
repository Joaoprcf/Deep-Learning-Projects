0,Marjane Satrapi,"When you make a book or you make a movie, it is almost like hitting on somebody.

But when you hit on them and it works, then it's really cool.","[cool, book, people]",work
1,Kirsten Dunst,"I would love to work with Quentin Tarantino - he's my number one. My ultimate. I would love to work with Paul Thomas Anderson, Alexander Payne - Pedro Almodovar wouldn't be too shabby.

4,Tim Burton,"I think of Ray Harryhausen's work - I knew his name before I knew any actor or director's names. His films had an impact on me very early on, probably even more than Disney. I think that's what made me interested in animation: His work.","[impact, me, name]",work
5,Chris Pine,"I feel prematurely old. I'm actually having this major belated quarter-life crisis. I'm turning 30 in a couple of weeks. I've been thinking a lot about mortality. A lot about what I'm going to do with my life and how to enjoy it. One of the things I'm going to work on is being more spontaneous, letting go, embracing the beauty of come-what-may.","[life, beauty, thinking]",work

8,Ashton Kutcher,"I would just like a woman someday, somewhere, at some point in my life to say to me, 'You're a great listener.' Haven't heard it yet, and that's a superior compliment to get from a woman. But I'm going to work on it.","[life, great, woman]",work
9,J. I. Packer,"In some Old Testament books, it's very evident that an editor has been at work. That's quite all right. It's part of the process.","[process, old, right]",work

13,Sarah Silverman,"I definitely think that prescription drugs, like antidepressants, are prescribed so cavalierly, anyone can get anything, but I need it. I do think that it needs to work hand and hand with therapy.","[think, therapy, need]",work
14,Yoko Ono,"I never want projects to be finished; I have always believed in unfinished work. I got that from Schubert, you know, the 'Unfinished Symphony.'","[know, want, you]",work
15,Yoko Ono,"I always believed that my work should be unfinished in the sense that I encourage people to add their creativity to it, either conceptually or physically.

And that's how I was looking at it.","[music, creativity, people]",work

17,Damon Albarn,"I spent two years figuring out how I could turn it into something that would satisfy me as a musician but also make some kind of cross-cultural link. I feel that I kind of at least touched on the possibilities of cross-cultural music, but it is a lifetime's work, and I don't profess to be anything other than a novice at it.","[music, me, feel]",work
18,Tom Peters,"'In Search of Excellence' - even the title - is a reminder that business isn't dry, dreary, boring, or by the numbers. Life at work can be cool - and work that's cool isn't confined to Tiger Woods, Yo-Yo Ma, or Tom Hanks. It's available to all of us and any of us.","[life, business, cool]",work
19,Joss Whedon,"My dad would go to work every day and write in a room full of funny people. He enjoyed it. I know great writers who find the process agonising but to me, writing has always been sheer joy.","[funny, joy, dad]",work

25,Pete Rose,"Back in 1960 at Christmas time, I did work loading and unloading boxcars for Railway Express. That was a kind of weight training that helped me. I weighed about 160 when I started.
