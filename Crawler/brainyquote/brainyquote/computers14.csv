13,Felix Dennis,"Computers are wasteful of paper and time. Once, we'd get documents with a few errors. Now, people make hundreds of copies until each sheet is flawless and memos are duplicated endlessly. Managers get swamped with emails.","[time, people, paper]",computers

This is a huge gap between our experiences as children.","[relationship, technology]",computers
20,Jill Lepore,"Desktop computers - boxes inside boxes - began appearing in those cubicles in the mid-eighties, electrical cords curling on the floor like so many ropes.","[inside, electrical, many]",computers
