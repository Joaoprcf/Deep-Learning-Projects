0,Angel Cabrera,"I was very lucky because hanging out at a golf course was much better than being on the streets. Golf taught me a great deal.

The club was my home.","[great, golf, people]",home
1,Thomas Perez,"I'm proud to be Secretary of Labor. But I'm even prouder of two more important titles: dad and husband. I've been able to be all three.

9,Billy Porter,"I'm not one of those actors who gets so taken by a role that I can't live my life. I'm the type of actor who goes to work, transforms into a character, takes you on a journey, and then comes back home to be Billy. When I'm in it, I'm in it, but I know how to get out of it.
