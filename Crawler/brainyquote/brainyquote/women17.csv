0,Andrej Pejic,"In this society, if a man is called a woman, that's the biggest insult he could get. Is that because women are considered something less?","[society, woman, man]",women
1,Mika Brzezinski,"For many women, going back to work a few months after having a baby is overwhelming and unmanageable. As strange as it may seem, things get even more difficult for a working mom after the second and third baby arrive. By that time, the romance of being a modern 'superwoman' wears off and reality sets in.","[work, time, mom]",women
2,Michael Strahan,German women love American men. That's why a lot of American servicemen go to Germany - and never come back.,"[love, men, american]",women
3,Anna Deavere Smith,"Well, the terrible thing right now, and I don't know the statistics, but there's a growing concern in some communities about how rapidly people are sent from school to jail, how quickly they're put into the criminal justice system. And of course the rapidly growing number of brown people, both men and women, in prison. And this is terrible.","[justice, school, men]",women
4,Rene Russo,I have nothing against younger women and older men on screen. What is sad is that so many women over 40 who have so much to give aren't being considered to play opposite men their own age or younger.,"[age, sad, men]",women
5,Beth Ditto,"As a kid, I was always mad - just noticing the women at Thanksgiving, running around the kitchen, while the men were watching football. For one, I don't want to cook, and for two, I hate football. I was stuck in the middle.","[football, hate, thanksgiving]",women
6,Barbara Lee,"We need to honor our troops who served and show our support by giving our men and women who served the best health care, the best educational opportunities, and the best job training available. They deserve nothing less.","[best, health, giving]",women
7,Bernie Sanders,"If you ask me about my views on the environment, on women's rights, on gay rights, I am liberal. I don't have a problem with that at all. Some of my best friends are liberal.","[best, i am, friends]",women
8,Gene Robinson,"The state's interest in marriage is stability. Generally speaking, polygamy does not work for stability. Inherent in the whole polygamous movement is a deep and abiding misogyny and denigration of women. So polygamy is objectionable on lots of grounds.","[work, marriage, deep]",women
9,Candace Bushnell,I've always been fascinated by young women who come to New York. The characters in 'Lipstick Jungle' were once young women who came to New York and we see their early experiences through flashbacks.,"[young, lipstick, see]",women

12,Stacy Schiff,"For the several thousands of years before they became firefighters and physicians, women were sirens, enchantresses, snares.

15,Gail Collins,"How do you give smart, accomplished, ambitious women the same opportunities as men to reach their goals? What about universal preschool and after-school programs? What about changing the corporate mind-set about the time commitment it takes to move up the ladder? What about having more husbands step up and take the major load?","[time, goals, smart]",women
16,Neil Strauss,"A lot of guys are very intimidated by an attractive woman, and they dehumanise her because our culture perceives beautiful women as commodities. But I think if you're able walk up to a person and get to know them, and you see their flaws and their impurities, and realise that they're like you, then you can humanise them again.","[culture, beautiful, woman]",women
17,Neil Strauss,"Anyone who hates something feels threatened by it. A guy who says he hates feminism (a) doesn't understand or know feminism, and (b) is scared of powerful women. Most attacks come from fear.","[fear, know, powerful]",women
18,Tariq Ramadan,"Fasting is, first and foremost, an exercise for identifying and managing adversity in all its forms. With faith, in full conscience, fasting calls women and men to an extra degree of self-awareness.","[faith, adversity, men]",women

23,Les Dawson,"With wives, men hide behind the air of bravado, which is basically a defence mechanism, I think. Clever creatures, women. Very clever.","[men, clever, think]",women
24,Andre Leon Talley,"When I was a young boy, growing up in Durham, North Carolina, the women in my family were truly passionate about their clothes; nothing was more beautiful to me than women dressing with the utmost, meticulous attention to accessories, shoes, handbags, hats, coats, dresses and gloves to attend Sunday church services.","[family, beautiful, shoes]",women
