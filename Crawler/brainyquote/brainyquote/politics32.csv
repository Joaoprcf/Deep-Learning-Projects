2,Wolfgang Schauble,"As for the role of France and Germany: French politics is often more self-confident then German politics due to the catastrophe in the first half of the last century. If Berlin and Paris don't agree, then it is difficult to make progress in Europe.","[progress, difficult, agree]",politics
3,Zachary Levi,"I believe in incentivizing people. If you can incentivize people in anything, whether it's in politics; in life; in spirituality; in business; just take care of folks. Incentivize them and all of a sudden it's amazing the difference that you'll see.","[life, business, believe]",politics
4,Eve Arnold,I have been poor and I wanted to document poverty; I had lost a child and I was obsessed with birth; I was interested in politics and I wanted to know how it affected our lives; I am a woman and I wanted to know about women.,"[women, woman, i am]",politics
5,Johann Lamont,I love hard political debate and I love beating somebody on a political point but what I'm more frustrated by is the politics where you play the man not the politics.,"[love, man, political]",politics
6,John Key,"I was really fascinated by politics. It always has been part of my view that politics really is a calling or you wouldn't go into it, because it's demanding and potentially has a toll on you and your family.","[family, you, view]",politics
7,Anna Deavere Smith,"Somehow we can't live outside the politics of race. There's something very deep in all of us, that is taught to us when we are very, very little. Which is the disrespect and fear of the other.","[fear, deep, live]",politics
8,Dierks Bentley,"I mean, the last thing I want to do is be involved in politics.","[want, mean, involved]",politics
9,Terry Eagleton,"The conversion of agnostic High Tories to the Anglican church is always rather suspect. It seems too pat and predictable, too clearly a matter of politics rather than faith.","[faith, church, matter]",politics
10,Jim Broadbent,"In today's politics, it would be good to have politicians who are more upfront about what they felt and actually not trying to bend with every breeze. They're infuriating, all of them.","[good, today, trying]",politics
11,Ellen Malcolm,"EMILY's List has worked a lot with swing women voters over the years, and one thing we've learned is that they are very cynical about politics and politicians. They very much want help with the challenges facing them and their families, and they feel like most politicians don't understand or want to lift a finger to help them out.","[women, help, challenges]",politics
12,Diego Della Valle,"Businessmen should not put their finger in politics, because they tend to think only of their own self-interest. But I worry about the low morale in Italian industry and the lack of government initiatives to help the poor.","[government, help, worry]",politics
13,Mark Vonnegut,"I'm not an expert on the Middle East or terrorism or the use of military force or politics. It's all I can do to know a little bit about how to help people raise their kids and what to do when they get sick. When a war happens, I just hope it gets over with quickly so that how we take care of children becomes more important again.","[hope, war, children]",politics
14,Matt Taibbi,"Politics is about a lot more than winning and losing. I think politics at its best is about compromise, shades of grey and about issues.","[best, winning, losing]",politics

16,A. S. Byatt,"I am a profound pessimist both about life and about human relations and about politics and ecology. Humans are inadequate and stupid creatures who sooner or later make a mess, and those who are trying to do good do a lot more damage than those who are muddling along.","[life, good, i am]",politics
17,Lysander Spooner,Martyrdom is evidence only of a man's honesty - it is no evidence that he is not mistaken. Men have suffered martyrdom for all sorts of opinions in politics and in religion; yet they could not therefore have all been in the right; although they could give no stronger evidence that they believed themselves in the right.,"[religion, honesty, man]",politics
18,P. T. Barnum,Politics and government are certainly among the most important of practical human interests.,"[government, important]",politics

21,John McEnroe,"I'd like to be the commissioner of tennis, but do I want to get into politics? Sometimes I have delusions of grandeur that that would be an interesting, good thing. I'm talking about actual politics, like being a congressman, but then I see how unbelievably nasty it really is, and maybe I'm not quite knowledgeable enough to actually do it.","[good, want, tennis]",politics
22,Ian Goldin,"In many cases, water stress is more about politics, economics, behaviour and governance than absolute water scarcity. Better planning is needed, to allocate water where societal need is greatest, and to allow trade-offs between alternative uses.","[stress, water, greatest]",politics
23,Ezekiel Emanuel,"Where I came from, just nodding and smiling when someone expressed views was the ultimate insult. If people weren't yelling about politics in our house then they were arguing about music, or movies, or food.","[music, food, people]",politics
24,Paul Stanley,"I don't know what's more embarrassing, these musicians and actors talking about politics in interviews or the media actually giving them credibility about it.

25,Morgan Fairchild,"I think sometimes women are not driven by the same, albeit, testosterone power thing that pushes men to get into politics.","[women, power, men]",politics
