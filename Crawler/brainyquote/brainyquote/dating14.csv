0,Lauren London,"I feel like there is always a rumor that I'm dating someone that I never met before. People have their judgments and ideas of who I am, and they know nothing.","[i am, people, ideas]",dating
1,Henry Cloud,People tend to look at dating sort of like a safari - like they're trying to land the trophy.,"[people, trying, look]",dating
2,Toni Braxton,"Dating is different when you get older. You're not as trusting, or as eager to get back out there and expose yourself to someone.","[yourself, someone, you]",dating
3,Jason Schwartzman,I don't know the first real thing about the dating game. I don't know how to talk to a specific person and connect. I just think you have to go to person by person and do the best you can with people in general.,"[best, people, game]",dating
4,Zoe Lister-Jones,"Women always try to see the one good part of The Weird Guy because the dating landscape is so bleak. Women will say, 'He's very odd, but he likes to cook. He's creepy, but he makes good pancakes!'","[women, good, weird]",dating
5,Jason Schwartzman,Dating is just awkward moments and one person wants more than the other. It's just that constant strangeness. I think it's a very real thing.,"[moments, think, real]",dating
6,Serinda Swan,It's difficult dating as an actor because your free time is precious. The guy I end up with someday is going to have to love traveling.,"[love, time, end]",dating
7,Serinda Swan,I'm Canadian. The only difference between dating American and Canadian guys is whether you'll be watching football or hockey. I have no preference.,"[football, hockey, american]",dating
8,John Bytheway,"While I am aware of no counsel on whether kissing should be reserved only for post-mission dating or courtship, I am aware of plenty of counsel concerning honesty in our actions and treating others with respect and kindness. Casual attitudes about expressions of affection such as kissing can cause much grief and heartache.","[kindness, respect, honesty]",dating
9,Priscilla Presley,"You know, I had my mother and my father convincing me that he would be going back to Hollywood and he'd be back with the actresses and dating them and that he wasn't serious about me at all. So I had him saying one thing to me and my parents telling me something else.","[father, mother, parents]",dating
10,Meghan Trainor,"Growing up, I didn't get the talk of 'Make sure boys take you on a date and treat you right.' So I was the girl who wasn't dating and would just text.

14,Charles Jencks,"If you look at Gothic detailing right down to the bottom of a column or the capital of a column, it's a small version of the whole building; that's why, like dating the backbones of a dinosaur, a good historian can look at a detail of a Gothic building and tell you exactly what the rest of the building was, and infer the whole from the parts.","[good, small, building]",dating
15,Michael Patrick King,If I talk to a woman for more than five minutes I can tell you exactly whether she's an Aidan girl or a Mr. Big girl.

16,Moon Unit Zappa,"We had two rules growing up in my house: If you're going to take a shower, do it with whomever you're dating so you don't waste water; and if you buy one for yourself, buy six, because everybody's going to want one.","[water, yourself, growing up]",dating
17,Zach Galligan,"I knew a ton of actors and was friends with them, but I never dated actresses. I tried to date 'normal' people because the Hollywood dating rule is 'one star per couple' because it's quite a challenge to match the egos of two actors.","[challenge, friends, people]",dating
18,Lucy Liu,Everything I buy is vintage and smells funny. Maybe that's why I don't have a boyfriend.,"[funny, why, vintage]",dating
19,Usher,Appearance is something you should definitely consider when you're going out. Have your girlfriend clip your nails or something like that.,"[appearance, you, something]",dating

21,Taylor Hicks,I had to deal with being somewhat of an outcast because it's not socially acceptable to be a struggling musician. There have been times where I've felt sorry for the person I was dating. I felt she deserved better.,"[sorry, she, better]",dating

23,Jackee Harry,I don't mind dating younger men now.,"[mind, men, now]",dating
24,Jesse Metcalfe,I don't have a type. But one thing I can say from my dating experience is that a physical attraction will only take you so far. So you definitely have to have a strong intellectual connection as well.,"[experience, strong]",dating
25,Jesse Metcalfe,"I don't want to be one of those 40-something guys in L.A. still dating, still going out to clubs and chasing 21-year-olds. It's not a good look.","[good, want, look]",dating
