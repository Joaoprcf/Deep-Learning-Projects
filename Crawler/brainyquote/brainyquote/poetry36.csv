2,Simon Schama,"Somehow, the words don't have any vitality, any life to them, unless I can feel it marking on a paper. That's how I start. Once I'm off, then I switch to the laptop.

5,Simon Schama,History gives you insight of the same quality of truth as poetry or philosophy or a novel.,"[history, truth, quality]",poetry
6,Vikram Seth,I spent many years of my life as an economist and demographer. I was finally distracted by writing my novels and poetry. I'm enormously happy that was the case. I feel that with writing I have found my metier.,"[life, happy, writing]",poetry
7,Vikram Seth,"Those books of mine that are remunerative - I'm not talking about poetry here - take years to write, and I am never sure they'll be successful. So writing is a risk in more senses than one.","[i am, risk, writing]",poetry
8,Vikram Seth,"You know, I can imagine not writing a novel and writing poetry only.","[writing, know, you]",poetry
9,Colm Toibin,"The sentences I write have their roots in song and poetry, and take their bearings from music and painting, as much as from the need to impart mere information, or mirror anything. I am not a realist writer, even if I seem like one.","[music, mirror, i am]",poetry
10,Jean Cocteau,The poet doesn't invent. He listens.,"[poet, listens, he]",poetry

13,Khaled Hosseini,"There isn't, even now, a great tradition of novel-writing in Afghanistan. Most of the literature is in the form of poetry.","[great, literature, tradition]",poetry
14,Thomas Mann,"Solitude gives birth to the original in us, to beauty unfamiliar and perilous - to poetry. But also, it gives birth to the opposite: to the perverse, the illicit, the absurd.","[beauty, solitude, birth]",poetry

20,Robert Morgan,"Poetry, almost by definition, calls attention to its language and form.","[language, attention, almost]",poetry
21,Robert Morgan,The decision to write in prose instead of poetry is made more by the readers than by writers. Almost no one is interested in reading narrative in verse.,"[reading, decision, more]",poetry
22,Robert Morgan,"Teaching writing over the years intrudes on your own writing in important ways, taking away some of the excitement of poetry.","[writing, important]",poetry
23,Robert Morgan,"I don't think poetry is something that can be taught. We can encourage young writers, but what you can't teach them is the very essence of poetry.","[young, teach, think]",poetry
24,Robert Morgan,I don't think the creative writing industry has helped American poetry.,"[writing, american, creative]",poetry
25,Robert Morgan,"Some people swear by writing courses, but whether it really helps American poetry, I have doubts.","[writing, people, american]",poetry
