1,Soledad O'Brien,"When I left 'American Morning' in 2007, I'd focused on doing documentaries. But I thought 'Starting Point' was a great opportunity to be involved in the zeitgeist.","[great, opportunity, thought]",morning
2,Renee Ellmers,The biggest need that women have is more time. We all want more time in our lives. More time in the morning to get ready. More time in the evening to spend time with our families. All of these things - more time to move up that career path. It's about time.,"[time, women, path]",morning
3,James Corden,My biggest tip is this... treat bread like chocolate. You wouldn't have a chocolate bar in the morning and then a double chocolate bar at lunch and then some chocolate before dinner. I was essentially eating a loaf of bread a day. And that doesn't work for me.,"[work, day, lunch]",morning
4,Kelly Stables,"I'm at the stage in my pregnancy where I don't feel pregnant. You feel very, 'Oh yeah, I'm pregnant,' because you're over the morning sickness and it's not too uncomfortable. It's fun.","[fun, sickness, you]",morning
5,Magda Apanowicz,"Is it crazy to say that I don't often eat breakfast? But every time I go to a diner, I have to have a breakfast-type item, even if it's 11:30 at night. I love my morning eats!","[love, time, night]",morning
6,Rena Sofer,"I find that when you do yoga, you don't crave unhealthy food. But I try to always let myself eat whatever I want. I have dessert or chocolate every day, but I'll only have a few bites. I try to have a little bit of cereal in the morning, and then I always try to have protein for dinner, too. But I eat pasta and stuff like that.","[food, myself, day]",morning
7,Hugh Jackman,"I do heavy weights in the morning for about an hour, and then I do 45 minutes of higher-volume lifting in the afternoon. My least favorite is the legs... I do quite a few chin-ups and rows. I do mostly old-school lifting with a lot of squats.","[legs, favorite, heavy]",morning
8,Thomas P. Campbell,My day starts at 8 in the morning. I have meetings through the day into the evening and very often dinners and benefits at night. This is nonstop.,"[day, night, meetings]",morning
9,Sara Foster,"I had bad skin as a teenager, and I spent all my money on facials and laser treatments and creams and cleansers and serums and all that.

Then I use serum called DNA repair serum, and it's made by Raj Kanodia.","[money, rose, wake up]",morning
10,Casey Wilson,"At my wedding, I was dancing so furiously that I fell hard on my kneecaps. The next morning, my knees were so swollen that I had to get a wheelchair at the airport to go on my honeymoon.","[wedding, honeymoon, dancing]",morning

And then we leave, and then I wake up the next morning and say to my wife, 'We don't go out anymore.' It's a great trick.","[home, great, wife]",morning
16,Ike Barinholtz,"I do two cups of coffee with a little bit of raw sugar and soy creamer, and then I do a bowl of plain oatmeal with walnuts and blueberries. Now, if I could do what I really wanted to do with my life, every morning I would have a salami-and-cheese omelet with hash browns and a buttermilk biscuit - and pancakes. But my heart would explode.","[life, coffee, heart]",morning
17,Montel Williams,"For me, I exercise every morning. I exercise every day. I work out about an hour and 20 minutes, which is aerobics and resistance training. I work on agility and balance. I work on the things that are going to help my condition. I do agility training. I walk on a treadmill. I use an elliptical. I use weights.","[work, day, training]",morning
18,Maeve Binchy,I thought it must be desperate to be old. To wake up in the morning and remember that you were ancient - and so behave that way. I thought old people were full of aches and pains and horrible illnesses.,"[people, thought, wake up]",morning
19,Michael Douglas,"Do you know what absolute happiness is? For me, it is to wake up my kids in the morning - these little pieces of innocence - to wake them and find they're so happy to see me! It is unequivocal love, no question about it.","[love, happiness, happy]",morning

22,Honore de Balzac,A good husband is never the first to go to sleep at night or the last to awake in the morning.,"[marriage, good, sleep]",morning

24,Henry Ward Beecher,"We sleep, but the loom of life never stops, and the pattern which was weaving when the sun went down is weaving when it comes up in the morning.","[life, sleep, sun]",morning
25,Joseph B. Wirthlin,We are ever on the threshold of new journeys and new discoveries. Can you imagine the excitement of the Wright brothers on the morning of that first flight?
