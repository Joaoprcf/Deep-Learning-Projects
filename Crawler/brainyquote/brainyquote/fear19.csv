1,Geoff Mulgan,"On the environment and climate change, I suspect that future generations will think there was too much timidity, too much fear of upsetting business. Basically, New Labour was very nervous about regulating business, or requiring it to do anything, even when there was a very clear social or environmental case for doing so.","[change, business, future]",fear
2,Frank Serpico,An honest cop still can't find a place to go and complain without fear of recrimination. The blue wall will always be there because the system supports it.,"[blue, find, place]",fear
