0,Greg Boyle,"I always have a funny story at communion time that underscores that no one is perfect, and that communion is not for perfect people but for hungry people.","[time, people, perfect]",funny
1,Greg Behrendt,"I don't know if you know you're funny, but you enjoy being funny. I know I'm funny because people tell me I am, but when I watch myself, it doesn't make me laugh. Does that make sense? Because I know the jokes, and to me, I feel like I'm pulling the wool over people's eyes. And there are probably people who do not enjoy what I do.","[myself, eyes, i am]",funny
2,Brian Helgeland,"I always think any circumstances can be funny. Not that I'm irresponsible, but when things go wrong, I always come up with a joke or think of something funny to say.","[circumstances, think]",funny
3,Prince Fielder,The gummy bears tattoo was my idea. It's my son's favorite candy. The sketch was my other son's idea. It's a self-portrait of himself. I just showed the artist his sketch and had him tattoo it on my forearm. It looks like a stick person with big hair. It's pretty funny.,"[son, hair, artist]",funny
4,Ryan Hansen,"Girls don't poop, so don't claim you do. You can fart - because farting is funny - but we don't want to know that you poop.","[know, want, you]",funny
5,Cameron Boyce,"Kevin Hart. He's the man! I like his style. He's short, so I can relate. All the stories he tells are real. I respect that, and he's just a really funny dude - great comedy instincts. To do stand-up on a stage for an hour and tell stories and make people laugh is incredible.","[respect, great, man]",funny
6,Michael Keaton,"I read that John Hughes script for 'Mr. Mom,' and I thought, 'This guy is a funny writer.' I went: 'You ought to stick around and direct this thing.' But he didn't; he left, and look what he became. A really legendary comedy director.","[mom, thought, look]",funny
7,Kurt Fuller,"I grew up as a very sarcastic person. I was always the class clown, and to date girls, I had to be really funny. I was really skinny growing up. I was so thin, I had to run around in the shower to get wet. That kind of thin. So I always had to rely on humor and sarcasm.","[humor, growing up, sarcasm]",funny
8,Kevin Spacey,"It's the details and the human element that makes 'Recount' entertaining. Even though we know how the election ends, it plays like a thriller. It's also funny.","[election, details, know]",funny
9,Elizabeth Banks,"Your funny gets developed pretty early on. Comedy requires that you understand as much as possible about the viewpoints of all people and everything that's going on around you. It genuinely requires a true point of view, a real sense of your own view of things in the world.","[world, people, point of view]",funny
10,Barry Humphries,"Now the point of comedy is not just looking funny, it's use of language. We have at our disposal a great language... and the imaginative, creative use of that language can be at the service of humour.","[great, service, language]",funny
11,Kara Walker,"I'm fascinated with the stories that we tell. Real histories become fantasies and fairy tales, morality tales and fables. There's something interesting and funny and perverse about the way fairytale sometimes passes for history, for truth.","[history, truth, morality]",funny

13,Christopher Stanley,"Up until the age of 9 or so, I was an incredibly happy, pretty well-adjusted, funny kid who made my parents laugh all the time. I was a bit of a clown, and I was really happy. And then my parents divorced, and I kind of turned into a different person.","[time, age, happy]",funny
14,Kelly Sue DeConnick,"My son is such a lover, such a caretaker and so funny. He's seven, and he genuinely cracks me up. And my daughter is a fearless powerhouse. They fill me with wonder and admiration.","[daughter, son, me]",funny
15,Melissa McCarthy,"Funny is funny, and it can come in 8 billion different shades and flavors, so I think it's silly to kind of limit it.","[silly, limit, think]",funny
16,James Welch,"The townspeople outside the reservations had a very superior attitude toward Indians, which was kind of funny, because they weren't very wealthy; they were on the fringes of society themselves.","[attitude, society, kind]",funny
17,Tobias Wolff,Memory is funny. Once you hit a vein the problem is not how to remember but how to control the flow.,"[memory, control, problem]",funny
18,Alex Borstein,"Usually, impersonations come out of something you dig, because you're listening to it over and over. And you kind of start developing... You're really trying to emulate them, then you realize, 'I sound ridiculous doing this. Oh, hey, maybe this is a funny impersonation.'","[listening, trying, doing]",funny
19,Michael Haneke,"'Funny Games' was conceived as a provocation. My other films are different. If people feel my other films are, or respond to them as provocation, then that's quite different. 'Funny Games' is the only one of mine where my intention was to provoke the audience.","[people, feel, audience]",funny
20,Georgina Chapman,"It's funny, because I sometimes feel that I'm most creative when I'm pregnant.","[creative, feel, sometimes]",funny
21,Tim Heidecker,"Sometimes laughing isn't the best judge of what's funny, 'cause I think there's a lot of things that are really funny that don't make you laugh, that don't make you physically, audibly make a noise, but is something that is much more powerful than that.","[best, laugh, judge]",funny
22,Jesse Williams,I'm always trying to find the next comedian that just gives me something a little funny to combine with all of the depressing news that I'm processing.,"[me, trying, find]",funny
23,Paul Haggis,"'Crash' came from personal experience. I saw things inside me from living in L.A. that made me uncomfortable. I saw horrible things in people and saw terrible things in myself. I saw a black director completely humiliated, but the three people around me just thought it was funny. 'No,' I said, 'that is selling your soul.'","[experience, myself, soul]",funny
24,Mario Cuomo,"A lot of my stories about the old days, they're delicious and funny. But every time I recall the early days, it's painful. With every anecdote, it's painful because you're summoning up the terribly, terribly difficult life of my parents. And it's painful because I didn't realize at the time how hard it was for them.","[life, time, parents]",funny
25,Lenny Bruce,When you're eight years old nothing is your business.,"[business, nothing, you]",funny
