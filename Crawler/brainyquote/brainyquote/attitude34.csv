7,Susan Choi,"I think 'Gatsby' is hobbled, in part, by its status as a Great American Novel.

14,Jennifer Sky,"I came on to the film with a very happy-go-lucky attitude which I think my character, Charlie, did when she went into the house. I expected it to be good, and then slowly things started to change for us all.","[change, good, character]",attitude

16,Neal Asher,"Gemmell's name guarantees a satisfying story and a thumping good read.

22,Hank Stram,You can't win unless you have good people with great attitude. They are the ones who won the games. I didn't win any games. You never saw a coach make a tackle anywhere.
