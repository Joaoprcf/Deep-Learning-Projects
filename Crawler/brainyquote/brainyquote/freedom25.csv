3,Laura Hillenbrand,"While it's really hard to do, at the same time, I'm escaping my body, which I really want to do. I'm living someone else's life. I get very intensely into the story, into the interviews and the research. I'm experiencing things along with my subjects. I have a freedom I don't have in my physical life.","[life, time, research]",freedom
4,Petra Nemcova,"I grew up under Communism so we could only learn Russian, and then when Communism fell in 1989 we could learn a few more things and have the freedom to travel and the freedom of speech - and the freedom of dreaming, really.","[travel, freedom of speech]",freedom

7,Chuck Palahniuk,"Personal identity seems like it's just such an American archetype, from Holly Golightly re-inventing herself in 'Breakfast At Tiffany's' to Jay Gatsby in 'The Great Gatsby.' It seems like the sort of archetypal American issue. If you're given the freedom to be anything, or be anyone, what do you do with it?","[great, identity, american]",freedom
8,Hal Sparks,"If you are for freedom and equal rights, which we hear a lot of talk about these days, then you have to include the LGBTQ community in that.

13,James McGreevey,"The arc of American history almost inevitably moves toward freedom.

14,Ai Weiwei,"Widespread state control over art and culture has left no room for freedom of expression in the country. For more than 60 years, anyone with a dissenting opinion has been suppressed.

That's the beauty of living in a free country and having the freedom to have an idea and become an entrepreneur.","[beauty, today, living]",freedom
16,Jonathan Sacks,"The Jewish festival of freedom is the oldest continuously observed religious ritual in the world.

22,Arthur L. Herman,"It is a fact that the Left routinely resists, then as now: Americans fought and died in Vietnam for freedom, just as they are doing in Iraq and Afghanistan today.
