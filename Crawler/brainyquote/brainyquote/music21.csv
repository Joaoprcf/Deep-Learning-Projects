0,Dolly Parton,I'm working on my life story. I'm not decided if it's going to be a musical or a movie with music in it.,"[life, my life, story]",music
1,Avicii,Dance music is like a virus: it has affected so many different genres.,"[dance, different, many]",music
2,Avicii,"When I started working on electronic music, that was after the rave period. I haven't even seen that part of it that much.","[working, rave, much]",music
3,Mac Miller,"I'm gonna make music, and I'm gonna capture every aspect of being a human being. That's really all I'm trying to do. I think that artists and pop culture identities are used to simplify what it means to be a human and pigeon-hole people into looking up to one role model.","[culture, people, looking]",music
4,Harry Styles,"You get a lot of who you are as a musician across through the music you write. If you're writing your own music, then it's important to be really honest.","[writing, important, you]",music
5,Harry Styles,That's the amazing thing about music: there's a song for every emotion. Can you imagine a world with no music? It would suck.,"[amazing, world, song]",music
6,Tony Hawk,"I feel like skateboarding is as much of a sport as a lifestyle, and an art form, so there's so much that that transcends in terms of music, fashion, and entertainment.","[art, fashion, feel]",music
7,John Patrick Shanley,"I'm Irish as hell: Kelly on one side, Shanley on the other. My father had been born on a farm in the Irish Midlands. He and his brothers had been shepherds there, cattle and sheep, back in the early 1920s. I grew up surrounded by brogues and Irish music, but stayed away from the old country till I was over 40. I just couldn't own being Irish.","[father, hell, sheep]",music
8,Brad Paisley,"There may be people in my audience who may not agree with me on some particular issue - you know, say, as a gun owner, they may not agree with me, or, you know, someone may not agree with me on a gay marriage topic. Any of those things. But those shouldn't be the reasons you listen to my music.","[marriage, gay, people]",music
9,Seamus Dever,"My wife Juliana and I first saw Eurovision while on our honeymoon in Greece in 2006, and we were amazed by it. They basically recreate a music video onstage, and pyro cannons, LED video screens, background dancers, fireworks, costume changes, and wind machines are their tools.","[wife, wind, changes]",music
10,Caleb Landry Jones,"Writing songs is an essential part of my life: my mother teaches piano, and I have inherited my grandparents' passion for music, especially from my grandfather Tommy, who was a great drummer. It's no coincidence that I play the drums best, but I am also good with the guitar and the piano.","[life, best, good]",music
11,Thomas Sangster,"I play bass. I play a bit of guitar. I've never been to a lesson, so my theory of music is non-existent in any instrument, but we always had guitars around. My dad taught me to play drums for 'Love Actually,' and I still play drums now. But I'm not a 'drummer.' I'm not a 'guitarist.' I'm trying to be a bassist.","[love, dad, me]",music
12,Nancy Gibbs,"New Orleans lives by the water and fights it, a sand castle set on a sponge nine feet below sea level, where people made music from heartache, named their drinks for hurricanes and joked that one day you'd be able to tour the city by gondola.","[water, sea, day]",music
13,Agnes Obel,"I really believe it's not bad to look back within music. I don't mean retro, but using your own memories to make a song because our memories are what make us who we are.","[memories, believe, look]",music
14,Maksim Chmerkovskiy,"Dancing has been in us, in people, since the Neanderthal age. There's something about moving, something about interpreting yourself to the music, that's attractive, that's interesting, that's intriguing, and everyone wishes they could do that.","[age, yourself, moving]",music
15,John Tesh,"When I was first writing, I was writing mostly about sporting events, which was really what my assignments were. I was working on the Tour de France bike race and the Barcelona Olympic Games, and those songs tend to be very big, very bombastic-type music, which is the type of music that I love to write.","[love, writing, bike]",music
16,Isaac Hayes,"I've been around a long time, and when I was at the top of the hill, I was very ahead of my time! Evidence of that is that my music is still current today - you know, rappers sample it all the time. So, rather than compromise my artistic integrity, I concentrated on movies.","[time, integrity, today]",music
17,David Sanborn,"Everyone goes through the ups and downs of living - fretting about the future, worrying about what happened. Music teaches us how to be in the moment.","[future, moment, living]",music
18,Ted Cruz,"I'll tell you sort of an odd story: My music taste changed on 9/11. And it's very strange. I actually intellectually find this very curious. But on 9/11, I didn't like how rock music responded. And country music collectively, the way they responded, it resonated with me.","[me, find, story]",music
19,Stewart Butterfield,"I think there's a deep impulse in most humans to do creative stuff, whether that's music or art, photography or writing. Most people at some point in their life say they want to do something creative - they want to be an actor, a director, a writer, a poet, a painter or whatever.","[life, art, deep]",music
20,Jade Jagger,The best parties have always been at my house in Ibiza. They start with a bit of music and a barbecue by the pool.,"[best, start, always]",music
21,Kenneth Branagh,"I think that music is crucially important in Shakespeare - and, clearly, was an important part of the Elizabethan theatre. And, it's always been something that was a profound element of the experience of Shakespeare that I have been drawn to - and interpreters have, as well.","[experience, theatre]",music
22,Prince Royce,"I think behind every great man there's got to be a great woman, whether she's your wife, your girlfriend or not. I'm not gonna say that there's not that special girl out there. But I'm in the music biz, and I'm focused on the music.","[great, woman, man]",music
23,Charlie Puth,"I started piano when I was four. My mom taught me. And then I went to Manhattan School of Music during high school, like every Saturday. And then I went to Berklee for college, in Boston.","[mom, college, school]",music
24,Kim Fields,"Gospel music to me has always been a balm for the soul. It has been able to usher in the spirit, usher in worship, true worship and praise, healing. I find the music to be very good at healing and the passion, you know, which is a testimony being told in song.","[good, passion, soul]",music
25,Leon Bridges,People have this perception of soul music of somebody shouting.,"[soul, people, perception]",music
