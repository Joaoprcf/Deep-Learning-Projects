0,Anton Yelchin,I prefer when movies target my heart instead of my mind.,"[heart, mind, target]",movies
1,Seth Rogen,"I don't make the best movies in the world, but at times, I do feel like I'm adding something to the cinematic community.","[best, community, world]",movies
2,Cory Monteith,"I was dirt-poor. I could barely hold down a job. Eventually, though, I started getting small parts on shows like 'Smallville,' 'Supernatural'... and lots of really bad sci-fi movies. I was running around the woods in wolf contacts, covered in fake blood made out of pancake syrup, roaring.","[job, small, fake]",movies
3,Rian Johnson,"I do love science fiction, but it's not really a genre unto itself; it always seems to merge with another genre. With the few movies I've done, I've ended up playing with genre in some way or another, so any genre that's made to mix with others is like candy to me. It allows you to use big, mythic situations to talk about ordinary things.","[love, science, me]",movies
4,Rian Johnson,"With 'Brick' there was the Dashiell Hammett influence, and with 'Brothers Bloom' there was a really strong Fellini influence - both those movies wore that on their sleeve.","[strong, influence, brick]",movies
5,Jim Parsons,"My choices in projects have all been character or role-based, and on a financial level, it's obvious: as an actor on a TV series, I get a wonderful paycheck, and a consistent paycheck, which doesn't always happen when you're doing theater or movies.","[character, choices, doing]",movies
6,John C. Reilly,I'm not a big fan of kids' movies that have this knowing snarkiness to them or this post-modern take on storytelling. I think that sails right over the heads of most kids. There's something to be said for a well-told fairy tale. There's a reason that these mythic stories stay with us.,"[said, think, reason]",movies
7,Larry the Cable Guy,"I was always a fan of the old-style comics. I loved vaudeville. I loved Milton Berle, Dick Shawn, Phyllis Diller, Don Rickles, Charlie Callas, all those guys. Hilarious. I love the Bing Crosby and Bob Hope movies, and Abbott & Costello. My television influences were 'Monty Python's Flying Circus,' 'Benny Hill,' and 'Hee Haw.'","[love, hope, flying]",movies
8,Larry the Cable Guy,"Doing a kid's movie is fun when you have kids. You don't want to do kids' movies if you don't have kids. When you have kids, things change in your life.","[life, change, fun]",movies
9,James Wan,"For me, the sound design and the musical score is a big part of what makes scary movies work.","[work, design, me]",movies
10,Sarah Silverman,"I have very vivid dreams - almost always action-adventure. I'm often on the run. I've always had dreams. When I was little, I'd go to sleep with my head on my hands, which were in fists like I was looking through a camera. I felt like sleep was the movies - just drifting off to the movies.","[dreams, sleep, hands]",movies
11,Mithun Chakraborty,"I would say the film world has stopped operating as one. We have divided it into Hindi movies, Bengali movies, Tamil movies and so on. Earlier, there was only one channel and we all knew what was going on. Today, it is hard to keep track of programmes due to the advent of regional channels.","[today, world, advent]",movies
12,Jodie Foster,"I had a certain career as an actor that I think was quite personal as well, and had a lot of integrity, but I wasn't writing my own things or directing my own movies.","[integrity, writing, career]",movies
13,James Franco,"There's a tacit belief that actors shouldn't write books, they're sort of allowed to direct movies but there will be a lot of skepticism, and they shouldn't do artwork or music. There are these invisible roadblocks to gain entree to these areas for actors, and you kind of have to crash through those invisible barriers.","[music, belief, you]",movies
14,Chuck Palahniuk,"Of the big horror movies of the '70s, you have 'The Omen,' 'The Sentinel,' 'Rosemary's Baby,' 'The Stepford Wives,' 'Burnt Offerings' - these are all romantic fatalist movies where there's a sort of glimmer of hope... but darkness wins.","[hope, romantic, darkness]",movies
15,Kris Kristofferson,"I never thought of acting as a creative process. Christ, I used to go to the movies and see Brando talking like he was trying to sell shoes, and he was great. I thought anybody could do it. Then I tried it, and I got so uptight, I'm limited as to what I can do on film.","[great, shoes, thought]",movies
16,Drew Goddard,"I think so much of the horror film is about our primal instincts, and our primal instincts are not just towards violence. It's also towards sex. I feel like horror movies, as much as they're about violence, they're also about sex. It's about our instincts, so in that regard, it's crucial that you honor both of those things.","[violence, honor, sex]",movies
17,John Wayne,Nobody should come to the movies unless he believes in heroes.,"[heroes, nobody, should]",movies
18,Casey Neistat,"I moved to New York City when I was 20 years old, started making movies non-stop. I didn't have any friends, so I would just sit at home all night editing on my iMac.","[home, friends, night]",movies
19,Maurice Sendak,"Oh, I adored Mickey Mouse when I was a child. He was the emblem of happiness and funniness. You went to the movies then, you saw two movies and a short. When Mickey Mouse came on the screen and there was his big head, my sister said she had to hold onto me. I went berserk.","[happiness, sister, me]",movies
20,Demi Lovato,"Now on Friday nights, if I want to go hang out with friends, I go hang out with friends. If I want to stay in and be in the hot tub and have people over to watch movies, I do that.","[friends, people, want]",movies
21,Nick Cave,"If beautiful movies can influence you to go out and hug your children, then we have to be honest and say that other movies can inspire you to do bad things.","[children, beautiful, inspire]",movies
22,Bill Burr,"If I can sell out clubs and theaters and play dirtbags in movies, and get blown up in a car or get the crap beat out of me in a movie, that's good for me; I'm good.","[good, car, me]",movies
23,Virginia Postrel,"Average Americans order nonfat decaf iced vanilla lattes at Starbucks and choose from 1,500 drawer pulls at The Great Indoors. Amazon gives every town a bookstore with 2 million titles, while Netflix promises 35,000 different movies on DVD. Choice is everywhere - liberating to some, but to others, a new source of stress.","[great, stress, choice]",movies
24,Thomas Bangalter,"Computers were never designed in the first place to become musical instruments. Within a computer, everything is sterile - there's no sound, there's no air. It's totally code. Like with computer-generated effects in movies, you can create wonders. But it's really hard to create emotion.","[computers, place, you]",movies
25,Virginia Postrel,"Scientists appear most often in horror movies. Through childlike curiosity or God-defying hubris, they unleash destructive forces they can't control - 'Forbidden Planet's Monsters of the Id.","[curiosity, control, monsters]",movies
