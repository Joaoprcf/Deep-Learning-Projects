0,Lisa Vanderpump,"I don't watch any television, hardly ever because I'm so busy. I always obviously watch my shows because I blog about it and talk about it, but no, I can watch the news in the morning and that's it.","[busy, television, news]",morning
1,Patty Griffin,"There's an imbalance when if a woman goes out for a walk at 3 in the morning and something happens to her it was somehow her fault, and with a man that's not true.","[woman, man, walk]",morning
2,Matt Mullenweg,"I do my best stuff midmorning and superlate at night, from 1 to 5 in the morning. Some people don't need sleep. I actually do need sleep. I just sleep all the time. I'll catch naps in the afternoon, or I'll take a 20-minute snooze in the office - just all the time. Our business is 24 hours. Our guys in Europe come online at midnight.","[best, time, business]",morning
3,Dustin Yellin,"My father had the bug. Ever since I can remember walking, he was waking me up at 5 in the morning to go to flea markets. As a kid, I couldn't really stand it, but as I grew up, I became that guy, and when I have kids, I am going to be doing the same thing.","[father, i am, walking]",morning
4,Apolo Ohno,"Being a competitor, you always believe you can come back. I'll be up at 3 in the morning watching World Cup races in my hotel whether I'm in Asia on a business trip or in New York City and have to get up in 2 hours.","[business, believe, world]",morning
5,Jermain Defoe,"When you get up in the morning and know you're doing something you love, feel fit and look after yourself, it's just a great thing to do.","[love, great, yourself]",morning
6,Drake Bell,"I wake up in the morning, walk downstairs, and just bang on the piano and write about what's going on in the world around me.","[world, wake up, me]",morning
7,Poppy Delevingne,"I never do anything that doesn't feel natural to me. I wake up in the morning and I know what to put on - it's my sixth sense, really.","[wake up, me, know]",morning
8,Naomi Wolf,"Since Reagan there has been this tradition, which has become a cliche, of promising morning in America, this fake optimism, we're the best, the city on the hill. In fact the great American task is self-scrutiny.","[best, great, optimism]",morning
9,John Lydon,"I went to visit Alcatraz years ago when I was on tour with the Pistols, and I really liked the atmosphere of the place. I genuinely, really, thoroughly enjoyed the whole morning there.

10,Christian Louboutin,"Fruit in the morning is such a big joy for me. I like to grab fruit from the tree, et cetera. I don't feel that way with vegetables. Fruit, you can eat it at any time, any moment, in any type of situation. I like everything about fruit; I like the color.","[time, joy, tree]",morning
11,Steve Harvey,"If you'd asked me then if I saw how big 'The Steve Harvey Morning Show' was going to be, I couldn't tell you.

13,Henry Cavill,"A large amount of constant activity will get things going. For example, training in the morning will have everything, all the juices flowing by the time you actually get to work. So, when you're at work, you've been already up for an hour or so or two hours, and you're raring to go where everyone else is still wiping sleep out of their eyes.","[work, time, sleep]",morning
14,Anne Graham Lotz,"I want to take my focus off myself and focus on God. It's like setting your spiritual compass so no matter which way you turn during the day, whatever comes up, then my thoughts go back to Him and whatever He said that morning.","[god, myself, spiritual]",morning
15,Mark Romanek,"The trick is falling in love with something enough, and being excited enough by something, to want to make that year and a half or two year commitment and wake up every morning at 5 to go deal with a whole day full of problems to get it up on the screen. You really need passion.","[love, passion, day]",morning
16,Jeremy Hardy,"Being in the latter stages of life means the morning is unkind to the reflection. It takes a few hours for the creases to fall out. By about 4 P.M., I look quite nice.","[life, reflection, fall]",morning
17,Nico Mirallegro,"I'm definitely a morning person. I wake up dead happy, looking forward to having my cereal!","[happy, looking forward]",morning
18,Silas Weir Mitchell,"I was in New York for a little while, doing some really bad theater. I did some great stuff, too, but there were Saturday morning theater performances in one-third-filled church basements. So, I paid my dues.","[great, doing, church]",morning
19,Art Donovan,"People tell me if I don't eat vegetables, I'm going to get scurvy. Well, what the hell. But I was never overweight as a player.

I'd have dinner on Monday, and then I wouldn't eat until Friday.","[monday, people, me]",morning
20,Cassie Scerbo,Breakfast is my favorite way to start off the day. This is usually what I order every morning on set: egg whites scrambled with broccoli and a side of well-done turkey bacon. Sometimes I add a bit of feta cheese.,"[day, breakfast, cheese]",morning
21,Chelan Simmons,"Every girl/woman in the world has flaws. Instead of focusing on your flaws when you look in a mirror, focus on the parts of you that you love; try to do this every morning. You will ooze confidence all day long.","[love, confidence, focus]",morning
22,Cherie Lunghi,"To keep my back from getting stiff, I have a strict regime every morning of stretching and do yoga once a week and Pilates. 'Strictly Come Dancing' in 2008 was great for my fitness.","[fitness, great, week]",morning
23,Lou Boudreau,"As far as sleeping goes, you're up and ready to go at six in the morning. Spring training was always a combination of relaxing and working, and I missed that quite a bit. I missed being around the ball field. A baseball. A bat. The smell of the uniform, you might say. Talking baseball. Seeing opponents as well as the Cubs.","[training, baseball, spring]",morning
24,Maya Angelou,"It's still scary every time I go back to the past. Each morning, my heart catches. When I get there, I remember how the light was, where the draft was coming from, what odors were in the air. When I write, I get all the weeping out.","[time, light, heart]",morning
25,Kid Rock,Make no mistake: Bob Ritchie's up early in the morning taking pictures of his son on the first day of his senior year. Kid Rock is passed out in a hotel room somewhere with four scantily-clad women.,"[women, day, son]",morning
