1,Lynne Reid Banks,"The '50s in general are written off as a boring decade following the turmoil of the Second World War and its immediate aftermath - the postwar Labour government, the cold war, the arrival of the New Look in fashion, etc. But I remember it as a very exciting time - a pioneering, rule-breaking time, especially for the young.","[time, government, world]",war
2,Richard Louv,"If war occurs, that positive adult contact in every shape is needed more than ever. It will be a matter of emotional life and death. There's not a handy one-minute way of talking to your kid about war.","[life, positive, death]",war
3,Gail Collins,"The middle of 'America's Women' is about the Civil War, and how women, black and white, confronted slavery and abolition. As in every other period of crisis, the rules of sexual decorum were suspended due to emergency.","[women, black and white]",war
4,Naomi Shihab Nye,"My father was very disappointed by war and fighting. And he thought language could help us out of cycles of revenge and animosity.

He was always very clear to underscore the fact that Jewish people and Arab people were brother and sister.","[father, revenge, sister]",war
5,Nassim Nicholas Taleb,"People have the problem of denial. This is one of the things I learned in Lebanon.

That's how they work.","[work, parents, people]",war
6,Stanley Ho,"Because I became a refugee in Macau during 1941, we had this war in Hong Kong, I fought for the government as an air raid warden for 15 days. Our government surrendered, Hong Kong Government surrendered, so I took a junk and came to Macau in 16 hours and I was a refugee, so that's why I was so much indebted to Macau.","[government, why, refugee]",war
7,Paul Engle,"Soldiers of the American Revolution fought that 18th century war with heavy muskets. In the early 20th century, we kids fought it every Fourth of July not only with exploding powder and shimmering flares, but with all of our senses.","[american, revolution]",war
8,Nathan Myhrvold,"Business is war! Its leaders are strategic commanders, who boldly snatch victory from the jaws of defeat - and who perform other acts of derring-do. This kind of talk sounds great in the boardroom, and, for that matter, in the bookstore, where dozens of authors counsel would-be corporate warriors.","[business, great, victory]",war
9,Anthony Hopkins,"I come from - I came from Wales, and it's a strong, butch society. We were in the war and all that. People didn't waste time feeling sorry for themselves.

12,Ishmael Beah,"I was one of those children forced into fighting at the age of 13, in my country Sierra Leone, a war that claimed the lives of my mother, father and two brothers.

14,Wole Soyinka,"A war, with its attendant human suffering, must, when that evil is unavoidable, be made to fragment more than buildings: It must shatter the foundations of thought and re-create. Only in this way does every individual share in the cataclysm and understand the purpose of sacrifice.","[evil, sacrifice, suffering]",war

20,Thurston Clarke,"In 1968, America was a wounded nation. The wounds were moral ones; the Vietnam War and three summers of inner-city riots had inflicted them on the national soul, challenging Americans' belief that they were a uniquely noble and honorable people.","[soul, america, people]",war

22,John Updike,"Mars has long exerted a pull on the human imagination. The erratically moving red star in the sky was seen as sinister or violent by the ancients: The Greeks identified it with Ares, the god of war; the Babylonians named it after Nergal, god of the underworld. To the ancient Chinese, it was Ying-huo, the fire planet.","[god, sky, imagination]",war

24,W. E. B. Du Bois,"I believe in the Prince of Peace. I believe that War is Murder.
