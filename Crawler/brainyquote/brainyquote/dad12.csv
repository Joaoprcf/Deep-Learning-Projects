1,Amy Chua,"I saw my parents come over. They were immigrants, they had no money. My dad wore the same pair of shoes, I had some ugly clothes growing up, and I never had any privileges.

22,Don Everly,"Dad wouldn't let me fool with his guitar much, because I'm left-handed, and I'd pick it up upside down.
