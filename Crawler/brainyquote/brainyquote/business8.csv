10,Muhammad Yunus,"I dismiss personal profit and focus exclusively on people and planet. That's what I call social business: a nondividend company dedicated to solving human problems.

Can anything be more down-to-earth than that?","[life, spiritual, decisions]",business
17,Bobby Bowden,There's a saying in my business that there are two kinds of coaches - those who have been fired and those who haven't been fired yet. That's kind of like prostate cancer. Every man will have it if he lives long enough.,"[man, long, kind]",business
