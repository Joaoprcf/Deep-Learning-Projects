0,Valerie Simpson,"Both my grandmothers had upright pianos, and I just knew how to play since I was a child. Nobody taught me. I sounded like a grown-up, and then I learned how to read music.

1,Katherine Jenkins,"Oh, stuff the critics. I don't care. Too many people are snooty about classical. Look, I wasn't brought up in a home where we listened to classical music.

8,Dana Spiotta,"I don't have a lot of skills, but one thing I can do is, I can compartmentalize. I can make that a little world that I can go back to, so I can be a waitress, or I can be a teacher, and then go and work on my book.","[work, book, world]",teacher

12,Marya Hornbacher,"My students know I have a life, they know I've written about my life. They know some detail, probably more than they know about their physics teacher, but I would've told them anyway!","[life, my life, know]",teacher

16,Adam Riess,"Your chemistry high school teacher lied to you when they told you that there was such a thing as a vacuum, that you could take space and move every particle out of it.","[school, space, you]",teacher

24,Hugh Dillon,"I had a great acting teacher in high school. But I didn't like acting because it took too many people to get the job done.
