1,Rod McKuen,I try not to put messages in my songs. My only message is man's communication with his fellow man. I want to narrow the gap of strangeness and alienation.,"[man, want, try]",communication
2,Bruno Maag,Why do only the Latin script when Nokia has a billion consumers? Typography is the bedrock of communication; it can really connect people.,"[people, why, script]",communication
3,Tony Bates,"The education process is moving beyond the traditional classroom/lecture setting. More and more teachers are seeking tools and techniques to engage their classes and enrich their lessons.

5,Paul Watzlawick,It is difficult to imagine how any behavior in the presence of another person can avoid being a communication of one's own view of the nature of one's relationship with that person and how it can fail to influence that person.,"[relationship, nature]",communication
6,Antoine Lavoisier,Languages are true analytical methods.,"[true, methods, analytical]",communication
7,Ashraf Barhom,"The two cultures of East and West are very different, and the priorities are very different.

8,William Wiley,"It's like there are all these languages available, especially in terms of image. Why confine yourself to only English? There's all these languages and possibilities and concepts to speak or communicate with.","[yourself, speak, why]",communication
9,Jeff Jordan,"It's near impossible to always be right when you're innovating. It's easy to get emotionally invested in it, but you need to monitor its impact like a hawk and react if you don't like what you see. And if/when you pull it back, you want to do that communication with transparency and humility.","[humility, impact, easy]",communication
10,Alexander Kluge,"As soon as you judge communication a little more rigorously, there is a possibility that the message will not be democratized. I have to say what I believe to be right.

11,Karl Lehmann,The interest in the supernatural in a very generic sense and in the spiritual is not in itself a factor that helps the communication of the Christian faith.,"[faith, spiritual, christian]",communication
12,Kristina McMorris,"On occasion, I like to reread my grandfather's letters. While leafing through them, I'm saddened by what is being lost in modern communication.

All too often, personal connections are brushed aside for the sake of convenience in a fast-paced world.","[world, grandfather, lost]",communication

But no more.","[people, ideas, calendar]",communication
16,Dan Pallotta,"It has been said that love is a function of communication. I believe that to be true. I believe, by extension, that human understanding is a function of communication.

17,Jeremy Heimans,Politics have been changed forever because of people. The Internet is one of the tools that has helped. And it isn't just politics. The new networked dynamics that are now possible with these new forms of communication are also changing the way people engage as consumers that demand more social value from corporations.,"[politics, internet, people]",communication
18,Mary Szybist,"I have always been attracted to apostrophe, perhaps because of its resemblance to prayer. A voice reaches out to something beyond itself that cannot answer it. I find that moving in part because it enacts what is true of all address and communication on some level - it cannot fully be heard, understood, or answered.","[prayer, moving, voice]",communication
19,Nancy Duarte,Words that are carefully framed and spoken are the most powerful means of communication there is.,"[words, powerful, most]",communication

21,Jessica Abel,"My drawing, like that of most cartoonists, is intended first of all to be functional: to create believable space and communicate information. My strongest point in drawing has always been my ability to show characters' nonverbal communication through facial expression and posture.","[drawing, information, space]",communication
22,Ray Tomlinson,"If you're looking for ways of getting quick communication, maybe texting is the way to go. People can't walk these days without having one hand balancing a smart phone. If that's the way people are going to live, it is the case that something that vibrates in their hand is going to get their attention more quickly than an email.","[smart, people, looking]",communication
23,La Monte Young,"If listeners aren't carried away to Heaven, I'm failing.","[heaven, failing, away]",communication
