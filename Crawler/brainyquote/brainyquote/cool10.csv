3,Nate Ruess,"I was in a really crummy pop-punk band. I think we did a whole bunch of Blink-182 covers, and we were on the fringe of losers and jocks.

13,Maggie Q,"It's just cool for a girl to be able to do her own thing. I do a lot of movies, and I'm very lucky, and I'm not complaining. But in movies, alongside big action men, we've always got to take a step back and let the men shine.","[men, girl, shine]",cool

19,Kirsten Dunst,"In high school I had a boyfriend who was super into rap, so I was into Too $hort and Wu-Tang for a little while.

21,Kristin Armstrong,"I think, as most of us do, I put such high expectations on myself that this spills over onto other people. And not everyone is wired this way.

22,Brian K. Vaughan,"I like animal sidekicks. They seem to be a pretty cool trope of post-apocalyptic fiction - just because if you're going to have this lone protagonist, they're going to need someone to talk to.
