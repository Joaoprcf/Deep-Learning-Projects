1,Lady Gregory,"It is what the poets of Ireland used to be saying, that every brave man, good at fighting, and every man that could do great deeds and not be making much talk about them, was of the Sons of the Gael; and that every skilled man that had music and that did enchantments secretly, was of the Tuatha de Danaan.","[good, great, man]",music
2,Yanni,"With instrumental music, it is traditionally hard to get exposure.","[exposure, get, hard]",music

4,Brian Wilson,"I listen to oldies but goodies stations, '60s and '70s music.","[listen, oldies, stations]",music
5,Edgar Meyer,"From the first moment that I can remember, I had identified myself as a bass player and it had everything to do with my father, who was a bass player. And he loved music, you know, as much as anybody I've ever seen. And that dynamic I just thought as somehow was a straight pass to me.","[father, myself, thought]",music
6,Geri Halliwell,"I love being on the beach - it's my favourite place. I can chill out, read, listen to music, play with my daughter.","[love, daughter, beach]",music
7,Rufus Wainwright,"In the music business, to survive for so long, you have to be able to cut off from your emotions sometimes. And being a father, you're faced with that situation. I know that my father was, with me. I understand why he had to be distant, because to rip yourself away, time after time, is almost more devastating.","[time, business, father]",music

9,Nick Cave,"The songs that I like are the ones that you can't visualize, that are just cries from the heart - those very straight, direct songs that make rock & roll music so wonderful.","[heart, you, rock]",music
10,Gerard Way,"My music is - I don't want to say my main focus, but it's what comes most naturally to me.","[focus, me, want]",music
11,Noel Gallagher,"I'm a little bit of a control freak when it comes to my music, unfortunately.","[control, freak, little bit]",music
12,Pink,"I wanted to do it my way with my career, and I had this arrogant notion that people weren't just interested in my music but me as a person. That was my bit of arrogance, I guess.

13,Steve Earle,The singer-songwriter has always played music that was stylistically rooted in the '30s and the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl. But the fact of the matter is that none of us remember the Depression firsthand.,"[great, depression, remember]",music
14,Andrea Bocelli,"'Passione' is a selection of the music moments that have accompanied my youth; a collection of cherished memories, of moments, of fleeting emotions, of sleepless nights.","[memories, youth, moments]",music
15,Jill Scott,"I've always been a firm believer that soul music never dies.

16,Sivamani,It's never too late to do anything new when it comes to music.,"[late, never too late]",music
17,Hunter Hayes,"I've always been shy, but I see that as a good thing because it kept me focused on music.

21,Chance The Rapper,"I don't know where people think I'm from, but I'm from Chicago. It's really just that. People wanna romanticize it and say, 'There's two sides to it, and it's a beautiful love/hate story of violence and music.' But it's really just a very scummy place where people don't have respect for other people's lives.","[respect, beautiful, violence]",music
22,Chance The Rapper,"I don't really like meetings, I like recording and performing music. I need to set myself up for when the time does come that I need better distribution or just a bigger team behind me.","[time, myself, team]",music
23,David Archuleta,"My mom is just someone who's easy to talk to and hang with. My sister, it's always cool to be able to help her out with things.

And my dad is someone who's helpful with my music and easy to talk to about that stuff because he understands me in that sense.","[mom, dad, sister]",music
24,Annie Lennox,"In a sense, the music business and I haven't always been the best of bedfellows. Artists often have to fight their corner.
