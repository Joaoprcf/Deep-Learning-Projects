2,James Gray,"My wife and I had been to the genetic counselor; my wife is not Jewish - she's the shiksha goddess type - and was negative for everything. But I was positive. I carried the gene for three genetic disorders, which, if she had been positive for, we would have passed down to the child.","[wife, child, negative]",positive
3,Robert Winston,"Nearly all inventions are not recognised for their positive side either when they're made. So, for example, scientists didn't go out to design a CD machine: they designed a laser.

9,Erin O'Connor,"I've been on both sides: the victim and the villain. I was the victimised model, and everything from my weight to my fertility was held up for discussion. And then I was the person that could garner some kind of positive outcome, by taking on the role of vice chairman of the British Fashion Council and becoming an activist of body image.","[fashion, body, victim]",positive
10,Erin O'Connor,"The Model Sanctuary is not about self-indulgence - it's about reminding and allowing them to become self-sufficient human beings.

11,Erin O'Connor,"The 'Best of British' is a positive thing that's bandied around, but also it's applied pressure to our country in terms of economic growth.

16,Mary Lambert,"I think no matter how you think about your music, you're ultimately in the music 'business.' I think you have to be business-minded in some sense. And for me, the real goal... is positive intention and social change through music. It doesn't mean that can't turn a profit.","[change, music, business]",positive
17,Brene Brown,"Guilt is just as powerful, but its influence is positive, while shame's is destructive. Shame erodes our courage and fuels disengagement.","[courage, influence, powerful]",positive
18,Astro Teller,"When we try to make a car that drives itself, we believe - whether we're right or not - we believe that there would be strong net positive benefit to the world if cars could drive themselves safer than people could.","[car, strong, believe]",positive

Especially in perpetuity; like, your music continues to go on and live without you. That risk is too great for me; I'm gonna keep it positive.","[music, business, great]",positive
23,Joshua Oppenheimer,I wanted to resist in 'The Look of Silence' making a film that ends with any kind of positive hope I feel in human rights documentaries dealing with human survivors.,"[hope, silence, human rights]",positive
