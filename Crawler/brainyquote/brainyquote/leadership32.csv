3,Ed Rendell,"I think national issues play into gubernatorial races less than, obviously, in Senate and Congressional races. Much less. They tend to be more decided by personality, leadership qualities and by state or local issues.

4,Sean Duffy,I think that bold leadership sells.,"[think, bold, i think]",leadership

10,Michael Arrington,"I've always believed that government tends to screw up whatever it touches, but Obama in particular seemed different.

But whatever the reason, I had real hope that he could help lead us into a new century of technology leadership and growth.","[hope, technology, age]",leadership
11,Shashi Tharoor,"The notion of 'world leadership' is a curiously archaic one. The very phrase is redolent of Kipling ballads and James Bondian adventures. What makes a country a world leader? Is it population, in which case India is on course to top the charts, overtaking China as the world's most populous country by 2034?","[leader, world, country]",leadership
12,Paul Broun,"I do go against my leadership all the time because I stand firm on the four questions that I ask about all legislation. The first, is it constitutional according to the original intent? The second, does it fit the Judeo-Christian Biblical principles that our nation is founded upon? Third, do we need it? Fourth, can we afford it?","[time, stand, questions]",leadership

19,George Pataki,"I can govern by bringing people together. And also, I've been tested in a way no one else has. I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time. And when I left, we were stronger, we were safer, and we were more united than at any time in my lifetime.","[time, together, people]",leadership
20,Jeff Greenfield,"There is something discordant about a team of speechwriters and political operatives hammering away to create an image of the 'real, inner' candidate.

Gates,"There is no international problem that can be addressed or solved without the engagement and leadership of the United States and everybody in the world knows that, its just fact of life.
