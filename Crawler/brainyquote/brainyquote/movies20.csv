5,Robert De Niro,"I'll work with a director if I think I'm going to get into a comfortable situation, and if it's someone I respect and who respects me, even if they're not so well known.

9,Taylor Lautner,I hope that I would be considered romantic. I don't know... one of my favorite movies is 'The Notebook' so I guess that would be considered romantic. But I think being romantic is more than the flowers and the gifts. It's about connecting with the person and being able to talk and share things with her.,"[hope, romantic, flowers]",movies
10,Emir Kusturica,Making movies is a dangerous job. Because you are always the one who stands at the center of the universe when making movies.,"[job, universe, you]",movies

14,Jason Reitman,"As far as writing, I like watching bad movies. Nothing stops me in my tracks more than watching a great film like 'The Godfather' or 'Dog Day Afternoon' or 'The Graduate.' You watch one of those, and you never want to write again. Whereas with bad movies, it makes you think, If that counts, I certainly could write.","[great, dog, day]",movies

I like his movies, I like his excess, and I think he has a great capacity for empathy and it comes out more powerfully in this movie than in any of his other films, even the formal 'I'm identifying with the underdog' movies like 'Born on the Fourth of July.'","[great, empathy, stone]",movies
21,Cameron Crowe,"I always loved movies, but I never thought I would presume to be a screenwriter and definitely not a director.","[thought, loved, always]",movies

23,Evan Peters,"I used to look at horror movies as being really real and it would totally freak me out and give me nightmares. Now I watch and think, 'whoa how'd they do that?'","[me, look, think]",movies
24,Kathryn Hahn,"Even the shows or movies that we know are not going to change the world, I love this. I love 'em. I'm a movie fan. I'm a nerd of any kind. I love a big studio comedy as much as I love the teeniest tiniest of indie. I'm not a snob in that way. I really do like a big, big studio comedy.","[love, change, world]",movies
25,Sarah Brightman,I love the intimacy of making movies. The focus is deeper and much more intense than musical theatre.,"[love, focus, theatre]",movies
