2,Richard J. Roberts,"Hard as it is to imagine, there's a move afoot in Congress to take away the public's free online access to tax-funded medical research findings.

And even then, we had the impression that so much of the excessive, aggressive medical treatment that took place at the end of life was not only unnecessary but it was cruel.","[life, health, end]",medical
9,David Agus,"I believe we can prevent or delay most disease until the 9th or 10th decade. The goal is to prevent anything that can affect your quality of life prior to those years!

19,Luke Perry,"Why doesn't Apple stop for a year and make medical devices?
