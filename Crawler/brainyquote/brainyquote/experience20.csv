0,Karen Kain,"To be able to make decisions and see them come to fruition and feel the excitement around them, what it generates within the company, how the artists get motivated - that's the most rewarding part; feeling I can be a catalyst for an artistic experience for our artists and for the public.","[decisions, company, see]",experience
1,Lucy Powell,"These are tough times and under this Tory-led government many people in Manchester are suffering and getting left behind.

4,Jonah Hill,"I've learned through experience of playing different characters, some of whom were jerks, that when you play a character who is pretentious or obnoxious, in any way, it's important to knock them down a peg.","[character, important, down]",experience
5,Jonathan Safran Foer,"Words are capable of making experience more vivid, and also of organizing it. They can scare us, and they can comfort us.","[words, organizing, comfort]",experience
6,Bryan Cranston,"I want to be able to experience everything. I want to experience being a husband, experience being a father, experience, maybe, hopefully, someday being a grandfather, and all those things. I want that experience.

13,Sharon Salzberg,"To remember non-attachment is to remember what freedom is all about. If we get attached, even to a beautiful state of being, we are caught, and ultimately we will suffer.
