0,Alan Shepard,"You have to be there not for the fame and glory and recognition and being a page in a history book, but you have to be there because you believe your talent and ability can be applied effectively to operation of the spacecraft.","[history, book, believe]",space
1,Duane G. Carey,"I'm looking forward to coming back, back to Earth, the landing, the views.","[looking forward, looking]",space
2,Duane G. Carey,Those folks out in the space suits are going to be getting beat up.,"[suits, beat, going]",space
3,Helen Sharman,"While we've taken seeds into space, and astronauts on the International Space Station have eaten lettuce they've grown, we haven't produced fruit in space, so we can't pollinate something.","[fruit, seeds, something]",space
4,Helen Sharman,"During launch, the outside of the rocket is covered in a protective fairing, so we couldn't see outside, but as soon as that was jettisoned, my first view of the earth was over the Pacific Ocean, which was this wonderful deep blue, with clouds just over the top, and sunlight streaming in through the window.","[deep, ocean, clouds]",space
5,Ralph Merkle,"One of the things that we can say with confidence is that we will have much lighter, much stronger materials, and this will reduce the cost of air flight, and the cost of rockets.","[confidence, stronger, say]",space
6,Laurel Clark,"Life science research can be done on multiple platforms. Since we have a very small number of people flying into space, the more people you have, the better.","[life, science, research]",space
7,Laurel Clark,"The microgravity or the very, very low amount of gravity that we have up in space forces some changes in different processes. It forces changes in us as human beings.","[changes, gravity, human]",space
8,David Chase,"I said it's a cold universe and I don't mean that metaphorically. If you go out into space, it's cold. It's really cold and we don't know what's up there. We happen to be in this little pocket where there's a sun. What have we got except love and each other to guard against all that isolation and loneliness?","[love, loneliness, sun]",space
9,Jim Lovell,"Houston, we've had a problem.","[problem, houston, had]",space
10,Eric Allin Cornell,"I certainly remember building model rockets. It was fun to watch the rocket blast into the air, suspenseful to wonder if the parachute would open to bring the rocket safely back.","[fun, building, remember]",space
11,David Mackay,"I was a frustrated astronaut all my life. I grew up at a time when space seemed to have no boundaries, and lots of us presumed humans would be living on the moon and landing on Mars.","[life, time, moon]",space
12,David Mackay,"I watched the moon landing as a boy, and I thought that was the most exciting thing ever, going into space, orbiting Earth and exploring other planets. That looked fantastic.","[moon, thought, earth]",space
13,John Desmond Bernal,"As the scene of life would be more the cold emptiness of space than the warm, dense atmosphere of planets, the advantage of containing no organic material at all, so as to be independent of both these conditions, would be increasingly felt.","[life, warm, cold]",space
14,Ellen Ochoa,"Astronauts are very professional and when they're preparing for launch, they prepare for it as the most serious endeavor of our lives.","[serious, launch]",space
15,Ellen Ochoa,"I'll tell you, being involved in human space flight, it is an emotional endeavor. I think it brings in the highest highs and the lowest lows.","[think, you, emotional]",space
16,Story Musgrave,"Most of our history in space has been communicated in terms of action - what people do, a chronological list of events which have transpired - as opposed to the human experience of having done those things.","[history, experience, people]",space
17,Story Musgrave,I would have taken whatever hand I was dealt. Space was it.,"[whatever, dealt, hand]",space
18,Gwynne Shotwell,"I left Aerospace because I wanted to go build, and put spacecraft together.","[together, build, go]",space
19,Leroy Chiao,"I'm Chinese-American, of course, and so it's very interesting to see China actually launch their own astronauts, becoming the third nation, following the United States and Russia, to do so.","[see, interesting, launch]",space
20,Alan Bean,Eventually there are going to be cities in space.,"[going, eventually, cities]",space
21,Stewart O'Nan,"Growing up in the '60s and early '70s, with the space flight and the Apollo program, I always loved planes. I always loved rockets and I always loved space travel.","[travel, growing up, loved]",space
22,Mae Jemison,"Sometimes people ask me how difficult the astronaut program was, but being in Sierra Leone, being responsible for the health of more than 200 people, seven days a week, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, at age 26 - that prepared me to take on a lot of different challenges.","[health, age, day]",space
23,Mae Jemison,I stayed in the astronaut program until 1993. People ask me why I left. I thought I had a lot of things to contribute that would be difficult to do if I stayed. I thought I could have a stronger voice as an advocate for space exploration. So I ended up starting my own technology consulting company.,"[technology, people, thought]",space
24,Michael J. Massimino,I think most astronauts are not risk takers. We take calculated risks for something that we think is worthwhile.,"[risk, risks, think]",space
25,Jill Tarter,"Earlier generations of stars in the galaxy could well have had planets. But really, there was only hydrogen and helium to work with, so they'd all be gas giants and not small, rocky planets.","[work, stars, small]",space
