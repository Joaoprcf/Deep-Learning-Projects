0,Rupert Sheldrake,"In both religion and science, some people are dishonest, exploitative, incompetent and exhibit other human failings.","[religion, people]",science
1,Timothy Ferriss,There are a lot of things that can be learned from the darker corners of athletics. You have doctors who view bodybuilders as cavalier amateurs of science. And then you have the bodybuilders who view the doctors as too conservative to do anything interesting. So I've tried to become the middleman for putting some of those pieces together.,"[together, you, interesting]",science
2,Kara Lindsay,I loved math and science. It just made sense to me. But my hatred for world history has come to bite me in the butt in my adult years. Every show I have done professionally has required me to study the world in which my characters lived.,"[history, world, me]",science
3,Deepak Chopra,"Science stands for rational thought, faith for superstition and unreason.","[faith, thought, rational]",science
4,Neil deGrasse Tyson,The idea that science is just some luxury that you'll get around to if you can afford it is regressive to any future a country might dream for itself.,"[future, dream, luxury]",science
5,Neil deGrasse Tyson,"You can't train kids in a world where adults have no concept of what science literacy is. The adults are gonna squash the creativity that would manifest itself, because they're clueless about what it and why it matters. But science can always benefit from the more brains there are that are thinking about it - but that's true for any field.","[creativity, thinking, world]",science
6,Neil deGrasse Tyson,"I was an aspiring astrophysicist, and that's how I defined myself, not by my skin color. People didn't treat me as someone with science ambitions. They treated me as someone they thought was going to mug them, or who was a shoplifter.","[myself, color, people]",science
7,Prince Charles,"It is baffling, I must say, that in our modern world we have such blind trust in science and technology that we all accept what science tells us about everything - until, that is, it comes to climate science.","[technology, trust, world]",science
8,Martin Rees,"Maybe the search for life shouldn't restrict attention to planets like Earth. Science fiction writers have other ideas: balloon-like creatures floating in the dense atmospheres of planets such as Jupiter, swarms of intelligent insects, nano-scale robots and more.","[life, ideas, earth]",science
9,Martin Rees,"It's often better to read first-rate science fiction than second-rate science - it's far more stimulating, and perhaps no more likely to be wrong.","[better, fiction, wrong]",science
10,James Corden,"I saw Boy George looking amazing, absolutely unbelievable, and messaged him asking for the number of his nutritionist. I got in touch with her, and she put me on this diet plan, working out which foods do and don't suit me. It's not rocket science - basically, don't eat cake, don't eat bread.","[amazing, cake, plan]",science
11,Jonathan Maberry,"'V-Wars' is a head-on collision of real-world science, terrorism, special forces action, ethics, politics and an exploration of what defines us as human.","[politics, ethics, action]",science
12,David Gerrold,"'Star Trek' is the McDonald's of science fiction; it's fast food storytelling. Every problem is like every other problem. They all get solved in an hour. Nobody ever gets hurt, and nobody needs to care. You give up an hour of your time, and you don't really have to get involved. It's all plastic.","[time, food, problem]",science
13,Walter Reisch,"The ultimate aim of all science to penetrate the unknown. Do you realize we know less about the earth we live on than about the stars and the galaxies of outer space? The greatest mystery is right here, right under our feet.","[stars, greatest, earth]",science
14,Margaret Atwood,"Please don't make the mistake of thinking that 'Oryx and Crake' is anti-science. Science is a way of knowing, and a tool. Like all ways of knowing and tools, it can be turned to bad uses. And it can be bought and sold, and it often is. But it is not in itself bad. Like electricity, it's neutral.","[thinking, mistake]",science
15,J. Robert Oppenheimer,"Science is not everything, but science is very beautiful.","[beautiful, everything, very]",science
16,Albert Einstein,No amount of experimentation can ever prove me right; a single experiment can prove me wrong.,"[me, wrong, single]",science
17,Charles Kettering,"People think of the inventor as a screwball, but no one ever asks the inventor what he thinks of other people.","[people, think, ever]",science
18,Edward Teller,"A fact is a simple statement that everyone believes. It is innocent, unless found guilty. A hypothesis is a novel suggestion that no one wants to believe. It is guilty, until found effective.","[simple, believe, guilty]",science
19,Ray Bradbury,The best scientist is open to experience and begins with romance - the idea that anything is possible.,"[best, experience]",science
20,Stephen Hawking,"Science is not only a disciple of reason but, also, one of romance and passion.","[passion, reason, romance]",science
21,Isaac Newton,To me there has never been a higher source of earthly honor or distinction than that connected with advances in science.,"[honor, me, connected]",science
22,Charles Francis Richter,Nothing is less predictable than the development of an active scientific field.,"[nothing, development, active]",science
23,Vitruvius,"For an object under the eye will appear very different from the same object placed above it; in an inclosed space, very different from the same in an open space.","[eye, space, same]",science
24,Irving Langmuir,The scientist is motivated primarily by curiosity and a desire for truth.,"[truth, curiosity, desire]",science
25,Neil deGrasse Tyson,"Asteroids have us in our sight. The dinosaurs didn't have a space program, so they're not here to talk about this problem. We are, and we have the power to do something about it. I don't want to be the embarrassment of the galaxy, to have had the power to deflect an asteroid, and then not, and end up going extinct.","[power, end, problem]",science
