They bought us bikes for Christmas but wouldn't let us ride in the street, we had to ride in the backyard. Another Christmas, my dad got me a basketball hoop and put it in the middle of the lawn! You can't dribble on grass.","[time, dad, sister]",christmas

15,Sylvia Plath,"In London the day after Christmas (Boxing Day), it began to snow: my first snow in England.

21,David Ogden Stiers,"The ebulliently sharp mind of 'White Christmas' director Walter Bobbie made me tremble and strive in the same breath. The deceptively 'simple' dialogue of David Ives, asking every actor to just. say. it. Float it on the breeze; it doesn't need 'explanation,' just energy and truth.","[truth, mind, simple]",christmas
