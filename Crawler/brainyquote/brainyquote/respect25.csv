0,Felix Dennis,"Nobody could like Donald Trump, surely, except his mother. No one really likes The Donald. But how can you not have respect for a guy who's been down on the floor and just keeps coming back? Nothing will keep Donald Trump down until they drive a wooden stake in his heart and a silver bullet in his brain.","[mother, heart, brain]",respect
1,Germaine Greer,"Women live lives of continual apology. They are born and raised to take the blame for other people's behavior. If they are treated without respect, they tell themselves that they have failed to earn respect. If their husbands do not fancy them, it is because they are unattractive.","[women, people, blame]",respect
2,Waka Flocka Flame,"It's a total big difference between a person that got lyrics and a person that can make hit singles. I'm a person that can make some hit singles. I'm not in no booth trying to be a lyrical genius. I'm preparing to make me some singles, and as I develop as a man, then they'll respect my emcee skills.","[man, me, trying]",respect
3,Benjamin E. Mays,Honest communication is built on truth and integrity and upon respect of the one for the other.,"[communication, truth]",respect
4,Shilpa Shetty,"I want a happy marriage and whatever it takes to achieve that. But I think the main prerequisite would have to be respect. He would have to respect me and vice-versa. And, that would be more important than being in love. I think respect really goes a long way. And he would have to keep me happy. And he'd have to be very, very, secure.","[love, marriage, happy]",respect
5,Martin Jacques,"Globalisation has obliterated distance, not just physically but also, most dangerously, mentally. It creates the illusion of intimacy when, in fact, the mental distances have changed little. It has concertinaed the world without engendering the necessary respect, recognition and tolerance that must accompany it.","[world, tolerance, mental]",respect
6,Jan C. Ting,"There is no quick fix for illegal immigration. But only when we achieve better control of our borders and better respect for our immigration laws can we give meaning to the discussion we need to have over reforming the numbers, categories, and procedures for legal immigration into the United States.","[control, meaning, legal]",respect
7,James Lankford,"Every person is created in the image of God and has value. Every person. Every person is to be treated with respect. Every person is also a citizen of some country. In their country, they have rights and responsibilities; in every other country, they are a guest.","[god, value, rights]",respect
8,Rod Carew,Harmon Killebrew was a gem. I can never thank him enough for all I learned from him. He was a consummate professional who treated everyone from the brashest of rookies to the groundskeepers to the ushers in the stadium with the utmost of respect.,"[everyone, professional, him]",respect
9,Hillary Clinton,"This is what we call smart power. Using every possible tool and partner to advance peace and security. Leaving no one on the sidelines. Showing respect even for one's enemies. Trying to understand, in so far as psychologically possible, empathize with their perspective and point of view. Helping to define the problems, determine the solutions.","[peace, power, smart]",respect
10,Cameron Boyce,"Kevin Hart. He's the man! I like his style. He's short, so I can relate. All the stories he tells are real. I respect that, and he's just a really funny dude - great comedy instincts. To do stand-up on a stage for an hour and tell stories and make people laugh is incredible.","[funny, great, man]",respect
11,Grandmaster Flash,"My father was my first inspiration. He had an incredible stereo and a turntable, and I was told not to touch it. But I'd go back and touch it anyway. I gained a respect for the turntables when I was a kid. When I was a teenager, I came up with a 'cueing system' to work the turntables because they didn't have it at that time.","[work, time, father]",respect
12,Martin O'Malley,"We are a people of many different religions and many different faiths. The only way forward in a pluralistic society of diverse faiths such as ours is to have laws that protect and respect the freedom of all, equally.","[freedom, society, people]",respect
13,Martin O'Malley,"Justice must be done in investigating the tragic death of Mr. Freddie Gray. His family deserves our deepest sympathy and respect for their loss, and our admiration for their courage in calling us, as a city, to act as our better selves.","[family, death, courage]",respect
14,Betty Wright,I respect women that have a voice and use it for a proper reason.,"[women, voice, reason]",respect
15,Heidi Hayes Jacobs,"Mapping does not purport to create an idealistic vision where all teachers agree, love one another, and gather around a campfire and sing 'Curriculum Kumbaya.' What it can develop is a sense of place, of respect, and of new grounds for discussion, disputes, and direction.","[love, vision, direction]",respect
16,Donald Trump,I have great respect for the Pope. I like the Pope. I actually like him.,"[great, him, like]",respect

18,Ted Sarandos,"I have a deep respect for the fundamentals of television, the traditions of it, even, but I don't have any reverence for it.","[deep, television, traditions]",respect
19,"Ross Perot, Jr.","The only hard-and-fast rules a Perot must operate under are getting a sound education; being honest and ethical in our business dealings; treating the people who work for us with respect and dignity; and, finally, a Perot cannot be afraid to take risks when appropriate.","[education, work, business]",respect
20,Barack Obama,We need to reject any politics that targets people because of race or religion. This isn't a matter of political correctness. It's a matter of understanding what makes us strong. The world respects us not just for our arsenal; it respects us for our diversity and our openness and the way we respect every faith.,"[faith, diversity, politics]",respect
21,Leo Buscaglia,"I have too much respect for people to try to control them. But they are estranged from love, afraid to reach out and touch one another. We're afraid to appear sentimental or speak in platitudes because people will say, 'What a jerk!' It takes courage in our culture to be a lover.","[love, courage, culture]",respect
22,David Bowie,"I do value the respect I get from my contemporaries, but to have Oasis cover my song, to have Puff Daddy cover a song, to have Goldie come along to my gigs - that's where my ego is at. To have my fellow musicians like what I do, that's very cool.","[cool, musicians, value]",respect
23,Narendra Modi,I believe mutual respect for one another and cooperation should be the basis for relationships with foreign nations.,"[believe, i believe]",respect
24,Jeff Sessions,"Scripture says, 'He didn't know the Lord, didn't respect the Lord, but the Lord used him to advance his kingdom.' I just believe that at this point in history, Trump will defend religious faith. I talk to him about that.","[history, faith, believe]",respect
25,Elizabeth Esty,We are a great enough country to respect the Second Amendment rights of lawful gun owners and protect our children. And those things don't need to be in conflict.,"[children, great, conflict]",respect
