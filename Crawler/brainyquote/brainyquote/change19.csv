0,Jennifer Hudson,"When people said Africa would change me, I didn't understand what they meant. To see the poverty in the townships, for instance, is overwhelming. I found it heart-wrenching to see young children walking barefoot and hungry in the dirt. I'm the kind of person who wants to change the world right here and now, so I got frustrated.","[children, change the world]",change
1,Macklemore,'Vote Love' means vote equality. It means vote change. It means vote what's right for humanity.,"[love, equality, humanity]",change
2,Kristin Bauer van Straten,"One lesson I got from Gandhi, 'Be the change you want to see,' haunts me. I just feel like I can't keep stomping around pointing the finger at BP when I am supporting the oil industry with my very own dollars and actions by buying their products, helping to pay their mortgage - plastic is from oil... polyester, shower curtains.","[i am, me, want]",change
3,Lea Michele,"I would tell 17-year-olds to be proud of who you are. Don't try to change yourself for others. Focus on school and your future. Boys and friends will come and go, just focus on you and your future.","[future, school, focus]",change
4,Jillian Michaels,"You can look for external sources of motivation and that can catalyze a change, but it won't sustain one. It has to be from an internal desire.","[motivation, desire, look]",change
5,Alison Sweeney,"One of the things I like best about 'Biggest Loser' is being around people who are trying to make the right choices. When you feel defeated about your weight and your health, like there's no hope, and you still make the choice to fight for it, to make the change happen no matter what people say or think, that's inspiring to me.","[best, hope, health]",change
6,Brie Larson,"Maybe you're not perfect, but you're willing to actually look at yourself and take some kind of accountability. That's a change. It might not mean that you can turn everything around, but I think there's something incredibly hopeful about that.","[yourself, not perfect]",change
7,Jennifer Morrison,"I really do see the good in people, and I don't want to change that. That's really how I view things, so sometimes I'll look past a lot of huge red flags because I see something else in someone. Then, of course, it always comes back to haunt me in the long run.","[good, past, people]",change
8,Carrie Ann Inaba,"I have this firm belief that I am who I am for a reason. If I change something, I'm cheating myself of whatever it is I'm supposed to learn from my body. You know, I'm legally blind. I'm 20/750, since I was in fifth grade. I wear glasses and contacts. But I won't even get LASIK.","[myself, i am, body]",change
9,Anthony Mackie,"The choices that we make through our lives, the people who intersect us on our path kind of change what our fated destiny is. So some of us are lucky enough for the choices that we make to keep us on our path.","[path, choices, destiny]",change
10,Lionel Messi,"I've never stopped being Argentine, and I've never wanted to. I feel very proud of being Argentine, even though I left there. I've been clear about this since I was very young, and I never wanted to change.","[proud, young, feel]",change
11,Mary Ellen Mark,"I'm not against digital photography. It's great for newspapers. And there are photographers doing great work digitally. When they use Photoshop as a darkroom tool, that's fine, too. But at this point of my life, after so many years, I don't really want to change, and I still love film.","[life, love, work]",change
12,David Attenborough,"It's coming home to roost over the next 50 years or so. It's not just climate change; it's sheer space, places to grow food for this enormous horde. Either we limit our population growth or the natural world will do it for us, and the natural world is doing it for us right now.","[home, food, growth]",change
13,Hoda Kotb,"People think that you have to do something huge, like go to Africa and build a school, but you can make a small change in a day. If you change Wednesday, then you change Thursday. Pretty soon it's a week, then a month, then a year. It's bite-size, as opposed to feeling like you have to turn your life inside out to make changes.","[life, school, day]",change
14,Linda Gray,I always tell people that my life is in pencil; I have to keep an eraser in my hand because I could always get a call that could change everything.,"[life, people, my life]",change
15,Jeff Goodell,"One of the big questions in the climate change debate: Are humans any smarter than frogs in a pot? If you put a frog in a pot and slowly turn up the heat, it won't jump out. Instead, it will enjoy the nice warm bath until it is cooked to death. We humans seem to be doing pretty much the same thing.","[death, climate change]",change
16,Mike McGavick,"There is no progress without risk, and in an environment where change is accelerating, risks are multiplying and businesses are increasingly complex, companies need strong, innovative partners to help manage their risk. Our brand clearly sets XL apart as the strong, innovative partner needed in today's market.","[today, progress, strong]",change
17,Sharon Salzberg,"We need the compassion and the courage to change the conditions that support our suffering. Those conditions are things like ignorance, bitterness, negligence, clinging, and holding on.","[courage, ignorance, support]",change
18,Rebecca Solnit,"To be hopeful means to be uncertain about the future, to be tender toward possibilities, to be dedicated to change all the way down to the bottom of your heart.","[future, heart, down]",change
19,Gary Zukav,"Religions cannot change you. If you are angry, you will become an angry Muslim or Hindu. If you are righteous, you will become a righteous Christian or Jew.","[angry, christian, you]",change
20,Ntozake Shange,"I write for young girls of color, for girls who don't even exist yet, so that there is something there for them when they arrive. I can only change how they live, not how they think.","[color, live, young]",change
21,Stacy London,"Seeing, feeling, thinking, believing - these are the stages of how we change our style on the outside and our self-image on the inside.","[thinking, style, believing]",change
22,Walter Dean Myers,"As a young man, I saw families prosper without reading because there were always sufficient opportunities for willing workers who could follow simple instructions. This is no longer the case. Children who don't read are, in the main, destined for lesser lives. I feel a deep sense of responsibility to change this.","[children, deep]",change
23,A. S. Byatt,"I am suspicious of writers who go looking for issues to address. Writers are neither preachers nor journalists. Journalists know much more than most writers about what's going on in the world. And if you want to change things, you do journalism.","[i am, world, journalism]",change
24,Robert Richardson,"Sadly, cinemas with film as the primary source are disappearing. We need to remain open to change. That does not require one to divorce the past but to respect and process both the present and the future.","[future, respect, past]",change
25,Jim Brown,"Money has changed today's black athletes. Those who have the ability as African men to bring a change in a community that so desperately needs it are concentrating only on their own careers, some charities and how much money they can make.","[money, community, today]",change
