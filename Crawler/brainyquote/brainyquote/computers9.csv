9,Marc Andreessen,"Technology is like water; it wants to find its level. So if you hook up your computer to a billion other computers, it just makes sense that a tremendous share of the resources you want to use - not only text or media but processing power too - will be located remotely.","[technology, power, water]",computers

25,Martin Rees,"Some claim that computers will, by 2050, achieve human capabilities. Of course, in some respects they already have.","[achieve, will, human]",computers
