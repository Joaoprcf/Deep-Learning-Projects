2,Jenson Button,"A lot of people think Formula One isn't a sport because everyone drives a car when they go to work in the morning.

4,Summer Sanders,"I love KIND bars. My favorites are coconut and almond and the dark chocolate and sea salt because staying fueled helps keep me from getting sick or injured.

11,Andy Cohen,"I have a Viking stove. The color is butter lemon, and I had to wait several months for it, because that color wasn't available and I really wanted butter lemon!
