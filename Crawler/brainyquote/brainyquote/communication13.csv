4,Esha Gupta,"I never even wanted to be an actress. I studied mass communication and wanted to study law in Newcastle, for which I even got a scholarship. But by then, I had started modelling.

9,Dick Costolo,"The way you build trust with your team is around super-clear communication in that instant when they say, 'I will be sad if you don't do X.'

11,Al Jarreau,"What I try to get beyond is playing music at people and, instead, to play music with people because audience members are constantly part of the experience.

20,Marlee Matlin,"There are many deaf people who couldn't imagine living in a marriage without someone who doesn't speak their language.
