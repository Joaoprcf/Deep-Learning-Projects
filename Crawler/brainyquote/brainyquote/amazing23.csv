1,William Gibson,"I'm quite proud of what I anticipated about reality television from my books in the early '90s, which I based on the early seasons of 'Cops' and on the amazing stuff I had read about happening on Japanese shows and the British 'Big Brother'.","[brother, reality, proud]",amazing
2,Tom Hanks,"One thing that was amazing about World War II was that everybody signed up for the duration plus six months. Fliers got to leave combat after 25 missions, or 35 missions, but other than that, you were in it. You were part of the great effort, until, oh boy, six months after it was over.","[war, great, effort]",amazing
3,Bill O'Reilly,"Many children fully realize their parents see them as astonishing creatures and incorporate that into their daily presentations. That is, they throw their stuff on the floor because if you are truly amazing you can pretty much do what you want. Right?","[children, daily, parents]",amazing
4,Vivienne Westwood,"We are the most amazing creatures that this world has ever produced, but we seem to also have this herd mentality; we seem to be the most stupid, also.","[stupid, world, mentality]",amazing
5,Whoopi Goldberg,"If I was doing a talk show, I would do the kind of show that comes on just once a month, with amazing guests.","[doing, month, kind]",amazing
6,Michelle Dockery,"I love cycling, but if I could find a way of building something above the streets for cyclists, that would be amazing. We need even more space.","[love, building, space]",amazing
7,Laura Carmichael,"I grew up listening in awe to stories of their wartime adventures. My granny, Joan, was a journalist and wrote amazing letters to my grandpa when he was a prisoner of war, while my nana, Mary, was a Land Girl, then a Wren. They were so independent, resilient and glamorous.","[war, girl, listening]",amazing
8,Michelle Dockery,"My godchildren went to see Taylor Swift in concert and got to meet her. They literally ran toward her and hugged her, and it was amazing. I got big bonus points for it. I'll remind them when they're teenagers.","[see, concert, meet]",amazing
9,Chris Abani,"I had amazing intellectual privilege as a kid. My mom taught me to read when I was two or three. When I was five, I read and wrote well enough to do my nine-year older brother's homework in exchange for chocolate or cigarettes. By the time I was 10, I was reading Orwell, Tolstoy's 'War and Peace,' and the Koran. I was reading comic books, too.","[time, peace, war]",amazing
10,Marvin Sapp,"Now we have so many different genres of music, it's amazing to me. Even in the gospel music arena, you've got hip-hop, you got contemporary, urban contemporary, you got traditional, you got neo-soul gospel, you've got all of these different things.","[music, me, hip-hop]",amazing
11,Virginia Postrel,"Airline glamour never promised anything as mundane as elbow room, much less a flat bed, a massage, or an arugula salad. It promised a better world. Service and dress reflected the more formal era, but no one expected air travel to be comfortable. It was amazing just to have hot food above the clouds.","[travel, food, service]",amazing
12,Paul Bloom,"Having kids has proven to be this amazing - for me, this amazing source of ideas of anecdotes, of examples, I can test my own kids without human subject permission, so they pilot - I pilot my ideas on them. And so it is a tremendous advantage to have kids if you're going to be a developmental psychologist.","[me, ideas, you]",amazing
13,James Corden,"This arrogance thing... I've had that my whole life. I flip between, 'Oh really? Oh, thank you. Wow. That's amazing' and, 'Yeah! Of course I am.' They're both varying degrees of a self-defence mechanism. It can be from minute to minute that I change.","[life, change, thank you]",amazing
14,Mary-Kate Olsen,"Some people are natural beauties, some have great style, but sometimes it comes from talent. Take Kate Winslet: I was listening to her speech at the Golden Globes. That woman has so much intensity. She's amazing to watch and to listen to. With some people, it can even be their voice that makes them attractive.","[great, woman, style]",amazing
15,Alexandra Daddario,"I went to an all-girls school for part of high school, and the idea of boys was amazing to me; like, all I ever wanted to do was kiss boys and be around boys.","[school, kiss, me]",amazing
16,Jennifer Damiano,"Female artists I love the most are Fiona Apple, Paramour and Regina Spektor - those girls that really write amazing songs themselves, and they're younger and cool. I'm not quite sure I could ever write songs like any of them, but if I could, I would.","[love, cool, apple]",amazing
17,Thomas Sangster,"I would like to work with Jean Reno, and I think it would be amazing to work with Jim Carrey. I would quite like to work with Robert De Niro and probably Christopher Walken.","[work, think, like]",amazing
18,Mitch Gaylord,Adrenaline is an amazing thing.,"[adrenaline, thing]",amazing
19,Jeff Dunham,"It's amazing how these little guys can say things that a mortal human could never get away with. There's some sort of unspoken license... when outlandish things come out of an inanimate object, somehow it equals humor.","[humor, say, human]",amazing
20,Britney Spears,"With love, you should go ahead and take the risk of getting hurt because love is an amazing feeling.","[love, love is, risk]",amazing
21,Sarah McLachlan,It's an amazing luxury to say I'm 31 years old and I'm gonna take a year off. That's pretty amazing.,"[year, luxury, say]",amazing
22,Bill Budge,I really think it is amazing that people actually buy software.,"[people, think, software]",amazing
23,Sanjay Kumar,I think that a lot of companies are still amazingly price sensitive.,"[think, price, sensitive]",amazing
24,Chris Hughes,People are doing amazing things right now on the Web.,"[people, doing, right]",amazing
25,Rick Rubin,I've gotten to work with amazing people. I would say usually we get to a point before we get into the studio where there isn't that sense of anxiety or nervousness of who they are because I don't think it would be as productive in the studio if that was the case. But maybe meeting someone like Neil Young for the first time made me anxious.,"[work, time, people]",amazing
