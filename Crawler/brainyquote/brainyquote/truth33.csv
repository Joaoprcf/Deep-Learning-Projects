3,Sloane Crosley,"It's funny. People often compare me to other humor essayists. They're usually quite nice comparisons; I will accept those gladly.

6,Sharon Salzberg,"The first of the four noble truths of Buddhism, that there is suffering in life, was enormously important to me. No one had ever said it out loud. That had been my experience, of course, but no one had ever talked about it. I didn't know what to do with all the fear and emotions within, and here was the Buddha saying this truth right out loud.","[life, experience, fear]",truth

It's not an argument that it's reasonable to believe that Jesus really was born of a virgin or that the Bible is the perfect word of the creator of the universe.","[life, good, religion]",truth
8,Harry Frankfurt,"Recognizing truth requires selflessness. You have to leave yourself out of it so you can find out the way things are in themselves, not the way they look to you or how you feel about them or how you would like them to be.","[yourself, find, look]",truth
9,Arthur L. Herman,"It is a fact that the Left routinely resists, then as now: Americans fought and died in Vietnam for freedom, just as they are doing in Iraq and Afghanistan today. Whatever mistakes generals and policymakers have made along the way cannot detract from that essential truth - which should be a part of any reliable history.","[history, freedom, today]",truth

13,Joshua Waitzkin,"The truth is that throughout my careers in both chess and the martial arts, I often knew that my rivals were more naturally gifted than me - either with their mental machines or their bodies.

14,Yehuda Berg,"In truth, we are all part of the team of humanity. And as such, we are all obligated to share ourselves, and our talents, for the sake of the team.","[team, humanity, talents]",truth
15,Nathan Myhrvold,"Elections, for their part, are typically popularity contests rather than measures of candidates' relative competency or effectiveness.

19,Bayard Rustin,"War is wrong. Conscription for war is inconsistent with freedom of conscience, which is not merely the right to believe but to act on the degree of truth that one receives, to follow a vocation which is God-inspired and God-directed.","[war, freedom, believe]",truth
20,Brian Blessed,"My parents taught me honesty, truth, compassion, kindness and how to care for people. Also, they encouraged me to take risks, to boldly go. They taught me that the greatest danger in life is not taking the adventure.","[life, kindness, adventure]",truth
21,Jessica Valenti,The truth is that we don't need everyone to like us; we need a few people to love us. Because what's better than being roundly liked is being fully known - an impossibility both professionally and personally if you're so busy being likable that you forget to be yourself.,"[love, be yourself, yourself]",truth
22,Jimmy Fallon,"Thank you... 'Real Housewives of Atlanta,' for demonstrating a universal truth: Idiots like me will always watch idiots like you fight on TV. You will forever be in my TiVo.","[thank you, fight, me]",truth
23,Jimmy Swaggart,I feel like it's my responsibility and my obligation to stand up and to say that which I believe to be the truth.,"[stand up, responsibility]",truth
24,Ayaan Hirsi Ali,"I assume the closest members of my family don't actually want to kill me, but the truth is that I have shamed and hurt them; they have to deal with the outrage that my public statements cause, and undoubtedly some members of my clan do want to kill me for that.","[family, me, hurt]",truth
25,Rudy Giuliani,Republicans spend too much time on defense. We have to be on offense. We have to point out the truth. President Obama stole seven hundred million dollars from Medicare. Republicans want to preserve Medicare. Obamacare robs from Medicare.,"[time, want, too much]",truth
