0,Jeff Bezos,Great industries are never made from single companies. There is room in space for a lot of winners.,"[great, winners, single]",space
1,Sylvia Earle,Any astronaut can tell you you've got to do everything you can to learn about your life support system and then do everything you can to take care of it.,"[life, support, care]",space
2,Shirley MacLaine,"I'd like to go to another planet, which I might live long enough to accomplish. Just get on a spaceship and go. But not the moon. I don't see any flowers there. The moon is too close. I want to go further.","[flowers, moon, live]",space
3,Chris Hadfield,I've been lucky enough to fly to space twice.,"[fly, lucky, enough]",space
4,Chris Hadfield,"As an astronaut, especially during launch, half of the risk of a six-month flight is in the first nine minutes.","[risk, launch, first]",space
5,Naveen Jain,"As a young boy growing up in rural India, most of what I knew of the world was what I could see around me. But each night, I would look at the Moon - it was impossibly far away, yet it held a special attraction because it allowed me to dream beyond my village and country, and think about the rest of the world and space.","[moon, world, night]",space
6,Ron Paul,"Well, I don't think we should go to the moon. I think we maybe should send some politicians up there.","[moon, think, politicians]",space
7,Daisaku Ikeda,"People need to be made conscious of a very simple reality: we have no choice but to share this planet, this small blue sphere floating in the vast reaches of space, with all of our fellow 'passengers.'","[simple, small, people]",space
8,Caroline Kennedy,"I feel that my father's greatest legacy was the people he inspired to get involved in public service and their communities, to join the Peace Corps, to go into space. And really that generation transformed this country in civil rights, social justice, the economy and everything.","[peace, father, justice]",space
9,Freeman Dyson,The question that will decide our destiny is not whether we shall expand into space. It is: shall we be one species or a million? A million species will not exhaust the ecological niches that are awaiting the arrival of intelligence.,"[intelligence, destiny]",space
10,Henry Spencer,"Supplying fuel for a Mars expedition from the lunar surface is often suggested, but it's hard to make it pay off - Moon bases are expensive, and just buying more rockets to launch fuel from Earth is relatively cheap.","[moon, earth, mars]",space
11,Henry Spencer,The Orion capsule uses an escape system quite like that of the Apollo spacecraft in the 1960s and 70s: an 'escape tower' containing a solid-fuel rocket that will pull it up and away from Ares I in a pinch.,"[escape, will, rocket]",space
12,Henry Spencer,"Reusable rockets promise much easier testing because you should usually get them back, and you can debug as you go rather than having to get everything perfect the first time.","[time, perfect, you]",space
13,Ellen Stofan,We want to make sure we get living astronauts to the surface of Mars.,"[living, want, mars]",space
14,Ellen Stofan,"Mars missions will require up to three years in reduced gravity, so we need to make sure astronauts can not only survive but thrive as they move outward to explore this new world.","[world, mars, survive]",space
15,Lawrence M. Krauss,"Empty space is a boiling, bubbling brew of virtual particles that pop in and out of existence in a time scale so short that you can't even measure them.","[time, short, measure]",space
16,Iris Murdoch,Perhaps when distant people on other planets pick up some wavelength of ours all they hear is a continuous scream.,"[people, hear, distant]",space
17,Nicolaus Copernicus,"The earth together with its surrounding waters must in fact have such a shape as its shadow reveals, for it eclipses the moon with the arc of a perfect circle.","[together, moon, earth]",space
18,Arthur C. Clarke,"Sometimes I think we're alone in the universe, and sometimes I think we're not. In either case the idea is quite staggering.","[alone, universe, think]",space
19,Leonard Susskind,Why is there space rather than no space? Why is space three-dimensional? Why is space big? We have a lot of room to move around in. How come it's not tiny? We have no consensus about these things. We're still exploring them.,"[why, big, consensus]",space
20,Roy H. Williams,"According to String Theory, what appears to be empty space is actually a tumultuous ocean of strings vibrating at the precise frequencies that create the 4 dimensions you and I call height, width, depth and time.","[time, ocean, you]",space
21,Roy H. Williams,"In essence, String Theory describes space and time, matter and energy, gravity and light, indeed all of God's creation... as music.","[music, time, light]",space
22,Valentina Tereshkova,"Once you've been in space, you appreciate how small and fragile the Earth is.","[small, earth, appreciate]",space
23,Valentina Tereshkova,"On Earth, men and women are taking the same risks. Why shouldn't we be taking the same risks in space?","[women, men, earth]",space
24,Valentina Tereshkova,"Hey sky, take off your hat, I'm on my way!","[sky, hat, way]",space
25,Alan Shepard,They say any landing you can walk away from is a good one.,"[good, walk, you]",space
