0,Jenna McCarthy,Subsisting on a diet drawn from one food group isn't healthy or gratifying. Even eating cupcakes 24/7 eventually would get old!,"[food, healthy, group]",diet
1,Ciputra,"I am healthy because of my strict diet. I can eat anything, but I don't eat everything.","[i am, healthy, eat]",diet
2,Hank Stram,"You can't be fat and fast, too; so lift, run, diet and work.","[work, fitness, fat]",diet
3,Emilie de Ravin,"Love is such an objective thing. I mean, I can say I love my family, or I love my Diet Coke. So I guess, in different ways, yeah, I do believe in love.","[love, family, love is]",diet
4,Renee Olstead,"The more I read and watched about the meat industry, the more determined I became to keep meat out of my diet. The things I saw in slaughterhouse exposes made me feel sick and I refused to just ignore what I now knew.","[me, sick, meat]",diet
5,Triple H,"Being on the road is no excuse for having a poor diet. I don't like fast food, but if I have to, I'll order three plain grilled chicken sandwiches and throw out the buns.","[food, road, poor]",diet
6,Rue McClanahan,I almost fainted. There was no family history. I had been eating a vegetarian diet and I exercised.,"[family, history, eating]",diet
7,Brett Hoebel,"If I could give one tip for people - it's not an exercise or nutrition regimen. It's to walk your talk and believe in yourself, because at the end of the day, the dumbbell and diet don't get you in shape. It's your accountability to your word.","[end, day, believe]",diet
8,Brett Hoebel,"If you think of exercise as a 60-minute commitment 3 times a week at the gym, you're missing the point completely. If you think that going on a diet has something to do with nutrition, you don't see the forest through the trees. It is a lifestyle. I know it sounds cliche, but you have to find things you love to do.","[love, week, commitment]",diet
9,Barbara Cartland,The right diet directs sexual energy into the parts that matter.,"[energy, matter, right]",diet
10,Daniel Nestor,"I've never been one to be too careful with my diet. If I really start watching what I eat, I'm already a thin guy - I just won't have any physical strength. I think I'll disappear if I don't eat what I need to eat or what I like to eat.","[strength, start, think]",diet
11,George Wendt,I dream about 'Cheers.' Like when you go on a diet and you dream of pizza. I always think of those wonderful years. I loved working on it.,"[pizza, dream, loved]",diet
12,Lindsey Shaw,I am involved in Greenpeace. And I just recently completely switched my diet over to near-veganism. So you try to do little things that you can. I recycle every single day. Every single thing in my house that can be recycled is.,"[day, little things, i am]",diet
13,Jorge Cruise,"The 3-hour Diet is absolutely safe - in fact it's not a diet, it's a lifestyle! Once you reach your goal weight, you just adjust the portion sizes slightly to maintain that optimal weight.","[goal, you, lifestyle]",diet
14,Valentina Zelyaeva,"Diseases happen in acidic environments, so it's very important to keep your body alkaline. Keeping a diet high in leafy greens, spring water, fresh air, raw almonds, lemons, grapefruits, and warm water with juice from half a lemon helps lower acidity levels.","[water, body, spring]",diet
15,Paul Fleischman,"I actually went on a vegan diet. So I was nagging myself there. I don't nag other people about it. It was sort of an interesting experiment, and I found it wasn't that hard at all.","[myself, people, interesting]",diet
16,Irwin Rose,My Ph.D. thesis problem was to determine if the DNA content of rat tissues increased if there was B12 in the diet. This problem was suggested by my adviser based on the observation that thymine could replace vitamin B12 in a lactobacillus.,"[problem, observation]",diet
17,Leigh-Allyn Baker,"If you're an actress, you're always on one diet or another - it's a way of life.","[life, way, you]",diet
18,T. J. Thyne,"I don't have a trainer. I have what I call 'the poor man's workout and the rich man's diet.' I run for 1 hour every day and do 500 sit-ups and 1000 crunches, and I lift weights at the Y for 28 bucks a month, even if it's 3 in the morning.","[morning, day, man]",diet
19,Oliver Jackson-Cohen,"It's never fun having to bulk up for a job on an action film, then lose weight for another role. I don't actually mind working out, but it's the diet: I'm half-French, so I love my food, and boiled chicken breast for breakfast is not my idea of a good meal.","[love, food, good]",diet
20,Justice Smith,I really don't follow a strict diet; I just watch my fat intake and stay away from fried foods.,"[fat, follow, watch]",diet
21,María Blasco Marhuenda,"We see that mice that undergo caloric restriction show a lower telomere shortening rate than those fed with a normal diet. These mice therefore have longer telomeres as adults, as well as lower rates of chromosome anomalies.","[see, normal, show]",diet
22,María Blasco Marhuenda,"We believe that such a significant increase in longevity is due to the protective effect against cancer produced by caloric restriction - incidences fall by 40 percent if we compare them with the mice that produce more telomerase and have a normal diet - and, added to the presence of longer telomeres, this makes the mice live longer and better.","[believe, live, fall]",diet
23,Mark Bittman,"The sad thing is, when it comes to diet, is that even when well-intentioned Feds try to do right by us, they fail. Either they're outvoted by puppets of agribusiness, or they are puppets of agribusiness.","[sad, try, fail]",diet
24,Mark Bittman,"Let me pose you a question. Can farm-raised salmon be organic when its feed has nothing to do with its natural diet, even if the feed itself is supposedly organic, and the fish themselves are packed tightly in pens, swimming in their own filth?","[fish, swimming, me]",diet
25,Mark Bittman,"The USDA is not our ally here. We have to take matters into our own hands, not only by advocating for a better diet for everyone - and that's the hard part - but by improving our own. And that happens to be quite easy. Less meat, less junk, more plants.","[hands, easy, plants]",diet
