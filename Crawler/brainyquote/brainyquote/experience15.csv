2,Deepak Chopra,The world sometimes feels like an insane asylum. You can decide whether you want to be an inmate or pick up your visitor's badge.

3,Joss Whedon,"I go to movies expecting to have a whole experience. If I want a movie that doesn't end, I'll go to a French movie. That's a betrayal of trust to me. A movie has to be complete within itself; it can't just build off the first one or play variations.","[trust, end, me]",experience

7,Gary Zukav,"The pain of powerlessness is excruciating. It is the most painful experience in the earth school, and everyone shares it.","[school, pain, earth]",experience
8,Gary Zukav,"Only choices made in love are compassionate. There are no exceptions. Do you have the courage to act with an empowered heart without attachment to the outcome? If not, you have no ability to give or experience compassion. That is the shocking truth.","[love, courage, truth]",experience
9,Jack Canfield,"People who ask confidently get more than those who are hesitant and uncertain. When you've figured out what you want to ask for, do it with certainty, boldness and confidence. Don't be shy or feel intimidated by the experience. You may face some unexpected criticism, but be prepared for it with confidence.","[confidence, people]",experience
10,Martha Beck,"Good-looking individuals are treated better than homely ones in virtually every social situation, from dating to trial by jury. If everyday experience hasn't convinced you of this, there's research that will.","[dating, research, situation]",experience
11,Richard Bach,"One of the great cosmic laws, I think, is that whatever we hold in our thought will come true in our experience.

13,Laura Osnes,I don't think auditioning will ever faze me again after the 'Grease' TV experience. It was fierce. There were thousands of people auditioning in four cities.

14,Bonnie Tyler,"I advise wannabe singers to form a band, practise in your garage if you have to, but do as many charity or open mic shows as possible to get experience.

16,Tom Stoppard,"I feel that when I began writing, I had a need to know more about the play before I got into it. I think that's the way I was thinking. But my actual experience is that the best way to find out what the structure is, is by writing the play out laterally. You just have got to be brave enough to start without knowing where you are going.","[best, thinking, writing]",experience
17,Marcel Duchamp,"Gravity is not controlled physically in us by one of the 5 ordinary senses. We always reduce a gravity experience to an autocognizance, real or imagined, registered inside us in the region of the stomach.","[real, inside, gravity]",experience
18,Patrick Ness,"I get tired of comedies where there are a bunch of funny guys and a beautiful woman who doesn't do anything funny.

20,Wayne Dyer,Fear is present when we forget that we are a part of God's divine design. Learning to experience authentic love means abandoning ego's insistence that you have much to fear and that you are in an unfriendly world. You can make the decision to be free from fear and doubt and return to the brilliant light of love that is always with you.,"[love, learning, light]",experience
21,H. P. Lovecraft,"Imagination is a very potent thing, and in the uneducated often usurps the place of genuine experience.","[imagination, place, genuine]",experience
22,Robert Baden-Powell,"It always seems to me so odd that when a man dies, he takes out with him all the knowledge that he has got in his lifetime whilst sowing his wild oats or winning successes. And he leaves his sons or younger brothers to go through all the work of learning it over again from their own experience.","[work, learning, knowledge]",experience
23,Milton Friedman,The only relevant test of the validity of a hypothesis is comparison of prediction with experience.,"[test, comparison, prediction]",experience

25,Jonah Hill,"I've never had issues with popularity. I was always a popular guy... I've always had friends and loved ones and everything, so it wasn't like, 'Oh man, I gotta fill some void that was left by high school.' I had a great high-school experience.","[great, school, man]",experience
