0,Walter Dean Myers,"I joined the army on my seventeenth birthday, full of the romance of war after having read a lot of World War I British poetry and having seen a lot of post-World War II films.

2,Mary Karr,"Poetry is for me Eucharistic. You take someone else's suffering into your body, their passion comes into your body, and in doing that you commune, you take communion, you make a community with others.","[community, passion]",poetry
3,T. S. Eliot,"Poetry may make us from time to time a little more aware of the deeper, unnamed feelings which form the substratum of our being, to which we rarely penetrate; for our lives are mostly a constant evasion of ourselves.","[time, may, feelings]",poetry

10,William Butler Yeats,"We make out of the quarrel with others, rhetoric, but of the quarrel with ourselves, poetry.","[rhetoric, others, ourselves]",poetry

12,David Knopfler,"I always liked the magic of poetry but now I'm just starting to see behind the curtain of even the best poets, how they've used, tried and tested craft to create the illusion. Wonderful feeling of exhilaration to finally be there.","[best, magic, illusion]",poetry

20,John Keats,"Poetry should be great and unobtrusive, a thing which enters into one's soul, and does not startle it or amaze it with itself, but with its subject.","[great, soul, amaze]",poetry
21,Roger Waters,"I think there are things in my story that have helped my creativity. Your father being killed, for instance, is one of the best things that could happen to a kid if he's going to write poetry or songs.","[best, father, creativity]",poetry
22,Lisel Mueller,"Memory and poetry go together, absolutely. It is a matter of preserving and of remembering things.","[together, memory, matter]",poetry
23,Sharon Creech,"I entered a poem in a poetry contest around 1987, and the poem won and I received $1,000 for it. That made me realize that maybe what I was writing was worth reading to people.

I don't think I solve problems in my poetry; I think I uncover the problems.,"[good, words, me]",poetry
