0,Michele Bachmann,"My parents were divorced when I was a young teenager, and I was raised by a single mother after that. So, I understand the difficulties that families have. I understand single parenting.","[mother, parents, young]",parenting
1,Caitlyn Jenner,"If you're asking your kids to exercise, then you better do it, too. Practice what you preach.","[exercise, practice, better]",parenting
2,Erma Bombeck,Never lend your car to anyone to whom you have given birth.,"[car, you, birth]",parenting
3,Stephen Curry,"You learn that there's no right way to do it, no wrong way to do it. It's just what you feel comfortable with, to trust that, and don't let anybody box you in to a certain style of parenting or make you feel a certain way about what your kids do.","[trust, style, learn]",parenting
4,Nicholas Kristof,"Most moms and dads, they want to be good moms and dads. But it's an incredibly hard job when you are stressed out, when you are poor, when your life is in chaos. And giving them some of the tools to be better parents, to whittle away at that parenting gap, gives those kids a much better starting point in life.","[life, good, giving]",parenting
5,Martin Jacques,My guess is that good and bad parenting is spread fairly evenly across different social groups. But can you imagine Tony Blair lecturing the middle class on how to bring up their children? He is far more comfortable as a latter-day exponent of the Poor Law mentality.,"[children, good, law]",parenting
6,Martin Jacques,"In my experience (I am the lone father of an eight-year-old boy who lost his mother when he was one year old), parenting is the most difficult of all jobs: forget your chief executives, editors, prime ministers and the like - parenting is far more challenging.","[experience, father, mother]",parenting
7,Sloane Crosley,"My grandmother was a kind of Scarsdale, New York, society woman, best known in her day as the author of the 1959 book 'Growing Your Own Way: An Informal Guide for Teen-Agers' - this despite being a person whose parenting style made Joan Crawford's wire hangers look like pool noodles.","[best, society, day]",parenting
8,Sloane Crosley,"Ah, the power of two. There's nothing quite like it. Especially when it comes to paying utility bills, parenting, cooking elaborate meals, purchasing a grown-up bed, jumping rope and lifting heavy machinery. The world favours pairs. Who wants to waste the wood building an ark for singletons?","[power, cooking, world]",parenting
9,Clive Owen,"Parenthood and family come first for me, and when I'm not working I'm cool with the Teletubbies.","[family, cool, me]",parenting
10,Clive Owen,"Very often when you see families it's all perfect and neat, and parenting isn't like that. You do have constant negotiations. Things are ever developing and ever changing, and you constantly have to evaluate how you deal with your kids.","[perfect, see, you]",parenting
11,Christie Brinkley,My work makes me a better mom. It gives me a little door to step out of my parenting and bring the excitement from my day back home.,"[work, home, mom]",parenting
12,Jane Fonda,"While not impossible, it is especially challenging for teenage parents to develop bonds with their children. A high percent of them were themselves children of teenage parents and have never experienced appropriate parenting.","[children, parents]",parenting
13,Bernie Mac,"I want to speak directly to the audience, to say, 'I'm like you - I'm frustrated, I'm not an expert, I don't have a manual on parenting, I make mistakes, I'm selfish too.'","[mistakes, selfish, speak]",parenting

15,Stephen Colbert,"That's my parenting style - 'Go watch the TV.' I'm one of 11 children, and my mother's parenting style was, 'There's the TV. Go watch it. Mommy's got 10 other people to take care of.'","[children, mother, style]",parenting
16,Harrison Ford,Parenting is an impossible job at any age.,"[age, job, impossible]",parenting
17,Shawn Amos,"In Los Angeles, parenting is a competitive sport. From Beverly Hills baby boutiques to kids' yoga classes, L.A. fuses high style, industrial-strength materialism, and parental outsourcing into our own unique version of child-rearing.","[baby, style, unique]",parenting
18,Erica Jong,"Women are individuals in parenting, and why not?","[women, why, why not]",parenting
19,Fiona Apple,"No, I've never wanted kids. But I do read about parenting a lot.","[kids, never, about]",parenting
20,Brene Brown,"My husband's a pediatrician, so he and I talk about parenting all the time. You can't raise children who have more shame resilience than you do.","[time, children, resilience]",parenting
21,Brene Brown,The uncertainty of parenting can bring up feelings in us that range from frustration to terror.,"[frustration, uncertainty]",parenting
22,Brene Brown,"Ironically, parenting is a shame and judgment minefield precisely because most of us are wading through uncertainty and self-doubt when it comes to raising our children.","[children, uncertainty, shame]",parenting
23,Brene Brown,"I'm not a parenting expert. In fact, I'm not sure that I even believe in the idea of 'parenting experts.' I'm an engaged, imperfect parent and a passionate researcher. I'm an experienced mapmaker and a stumbling traveler. Like many of you, parenting is by far my boldest and most daring adventure.","[adventure, believe, parent]",parenting
24,Ayelet Waldman,"There are times as a parent when you realize that your job is not to be the parent you always imagined you'd be, the parent you always wished you had. Your job is to be the parent your child needs, given the particulars of his or her own life and nature.","[life, nature, job]",parenting
25,Matthew Perry,"I would love to have kids one day. In fact, I'm pretty good with them. I grew up with five half-siblings, the youngest of whom is 11 years younger than me, so I think I learned some pretty cool parenting skills quite early on in life.","[life, love, good]",parenting
