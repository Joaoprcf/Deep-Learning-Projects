0,Daniel Radcliffe,"People tell me I look mournful. They say, 'Cheer up, Dan, it's not that bad!' Sometimes I just look into space, which freaks people out. If I was ever required to do anything other than look haunted, I could. I'm a happy person.","[happy, people, cheer]",space
1,Yoko Ono,Losing my daughter was a very serious pain. There was always some empty space in my heart.,"[daughter, heart, pain]",space
2,Sally Ride,"When the space shuttle's engines cut off, and you're finally in space, in orbit, weightless... I remember unstrapping from my seat, floating over to the window, and that's when I got my first view of Earth. Just a spectacular view, and a chance to see our planet as a planet.","[earth, chance, window]",space
3,Diane Ackerman,"As people flock to urban centers where ground space is limited, cities with green walls and roofs and skyscraper farms offer improved health and well-being, renewable resources, reliable food supply, and relief to the environment.","[food, health, environment]",space
4,Michelle Dockery,"I love cycling, but if I could find a way of building something above the streets for cyclists, that would be amazing. We need even more space.","[love, amazing, building]",space
5,Dick Cavett,"Anyone working in the media can tell you that there seems to be an always-ready-to-explode segment of the populace for whom offense is a fate worse than anything imaginable. You'd think offense is one of the most calamitous things that could happen to a human being; right up there with the loss of a limb, or just missing a parking space.","[media, loss, fate]",space
6,Wentworth Miller,"I noticed that I got a better space in the line in Starbucks when I had my tattoo. People associate tattoos with a certain edge. Then I open my mouth, and something completely different comes out.","[people, mouth, better]",space
7,Jason Mraz,Equality and separation cannot exist in the same space.,"[equality, same, separation]",space
8,Neil deGrasse Tyson,"I'm perennially intrigued how people who lead largely evidence-based lives can, in a belief-based part of their mind, be certain that an invisible, divine entity created an entire universe just for us, or that the government is stockpiling space aliens in a secret desert location.","[mind, government, universe]",space
9,P. J. O'Rourke,What Alexander Graham Bell thought up occupied less space than a flower vase. Now it's so small that I have to search all my pockets to discover I've received a spam text.,"[flower, small, thought]",space
10,P. J. O'Rourke,Space has always been confusing to politics.,"[politics, always, confusing]",space
11,P. J. O'Rourke,"The words 'Space Age' have a quaint, nostalgic tone - sitting on midcentury modern furniture watching 'The Jetsons.'","[age, words, furniture]",space
12,Noam Chomsky,The Occupy movement did create spontaneously communities that taught people something: you can be in a supportive community of mutual aid and cooperation and develop your own health system and library and have open space for democratic discussion and participation. Communities like that are really important.,"[health, community, people]",space
13,Dave Pirner,"I don't know... it's just too much fun to wonder about what life would be without gravity. I just started thinking about outer space more as an adult than I probably ever did as a kid. That was also inspiring, the concept of being stuck to the earth.","[life, thinking, fun]",space
14,Martin Rees,"Perhaps future space probes will be plastered in commercial logos, just as Formula One cars are now. Perhaps Robot Wars in space will be a lucrative spectator sport. If humans venture back to the moon, and even beyond, they may carry commercial insignia rather than national flags.","[future, moon, may]",space
15,Liu Yang,I am grateful to the motherland and the people. I feel honored to fly into space on behalf of hundreds of millions of female Chinese citizens.,"[grateful, i am, people]",space
16,Alan G. Poindexter,"I feel privileged and honored to have flown. It's been a tremendous ride, looking back on the legacy and accomplishments, like the Hubble telescope and the launching of the International Space Station in 1998.","[legacy, looking]",space
17,Mary-Kate Olsen,"I feel like when I carry a bigger bag, it looks like it's a huge bag because I'm really tiny. But I do think it's important to have the space that you need, because we throw everything in our bags at all times. I think every woman does.","[woman, important, think]",space
18,Mary-Kate Olsen,"I'm definitely bicoastal, but I have to say, it's easier to live in New York than in L.A. I feel like people respect other people's space a bit more here. Everyone has the right to that freedom, right? Everyone has that right. It's freezing in New York right now. In L.A., it's sunny. But I would choose freezing over being followed.","[respect, freedom, people]",space
19,Glen Duncan,"I will waste an extraordinary amount of time, you know. And if it's not watching television, I'll be sitting staring out of the window. And yes, I know there's the idea of the artist, sitting there doing nothing while things are going on, but actually, no. It's vacant space. I'm thinking about the laundry.","[time, thinking, artist]",space
20,Scott Bakula,"I haven't really thought about where to scatter my ashes when the time comes, but I doubt that it would be in space.","[time, thought, doubt]",space
21,Kevin A. Ford,"I enjoy going out to the plants, the factories where just some sub-element maybe of the orbiter or the space station is built. Those people take such pride in that component, and they build it to perfection, and it's just a pleasure to see that.","[perfection, pride, people]",space
22,Neil Young,"The rockets and the satellites, spaceships that we're creating now, we're pollinating the universe.","[universe, now, creating]",space
23,Sarah Brightman,"When you gaze at stars and think about planets, the places it takes your imagination are amazing! You look up the sky, and you know the stars have always been here; they were referenced in biblical times and have always been present. They are somewhere up there in the future, and they guide you; they make you feel safe.","[future, stars, sky]",space
24,Burt Rutan,"By 1973, we had a space station, the Skylab, and we had multiple probes going up to planets. So, all this wonderful stuff happened in 10 to 15 years. About that time, there should have been enormous initiatives to make it affordable for people to fly in space, not just a handful of trained NASA astronauts and Russian cosmonauts.","[time, people, fly]",space
25,Pat Buckley,I believe that there may be intelligent life on other planets.,"[life, believe, intelligent]",space
