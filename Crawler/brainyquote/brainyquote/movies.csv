0,Frank Darabont,"One of my favorite movies of all time is 'It's A Wonderful Life,' which is a pretty interesting choice for a seasonal Christmas favorite, because it's about a guy who wants to commit suicide and is presented with reasons not to.","[christmas, life, time]",movies
1,Alfred Hitchcock,"A lot of movies are about life, mine are like a slice of cake.","[life, cake, mine]",movies
2,Stanley Kubrick,"A film is - or should be - more like music than like fiction. It should be a progression of moods and feelings. The theme, what's behind the emotion, the meaning, all that comes later.","[music, meaning, fiction]",movies
3,Jonah Hill,"Look, at the same time that I don't want to be a celebrity, I understand that when you make movies you put yourself out in the public eye. I'd be a baby and a fool to be like, 'Why are there cameras taking pictures of me?' when I'm on a billboard for a movie. I think that's a very absurd concept.","[time, baby, yourself]",movies
4,Jean-Luc Godard,"A story should have a beginning, a middle and an end, but not necessarily in that order.","[end, beginning, story]",movies
5,James Cameron,"Pick up a camera. Shoot something. No matter how small, no matter how cheesy, no matter whether your friends and your sister star in it. Put your name on it as director. Now you're a director. Everything after that you're just negotiating your budget and your fee.","[sister, friends, small]",movies

7,Orson Welles,A film is never really good unless the camera is an eye in the head of a poet.,"[good, eye, camera]",movies
8,Boman Irani,"Nothing was planned in my career. I just went with the flow and took everything that came to me. Selling potato chips was obvious, as it was a family business. When friends suggested I should try theatre, I gave it a shot. Then I did a lot of advertisements, and then movies happened.","[family, business, friends]",movies
9,Alfred Hitchcock,Always make the audience suffer as much as possible.,"[possible, suffer, audience]",movies
10,Marilyn Monroe,"An actress is not a machine, but they treat you like a machine. A money machine.","[money, treat, you]",movies

13,George Lucas,"If the boy and girl walk off into the sunset hand-in-hand in the last scene, it adds 10 million to the box office.","[sunset, girl, walk]",movies
14,Spike Lee,"I think it would be very boring dramatically to have a film where everybody was a lawyer or doctor and had no faults. To me, the most important thing is to be truthful.","[lawyer, doctor, me]",movies
15,Stephen Chbosky,"When I did a study of all the coming-of-age movies that meant a lot to me, whether it was 'The Graduate' or 'Rebel Without a Cause' or 'Dead Poet's Society,' they all had that timeless feel. None of them were completely married to the details of their age. They felt timeless in their treatment of it. That's what made them resonate with me.","[age, society, me]",movies
16,Shailene Woodley,"My favorite movies are movies that I go in and I leave deeply affected. Whether I laugh really hard or whether I cry really hard, I just want to feel really affected in that moment.","[moment, laugh, want]",movies
17,Amy Chua,"In Chinese culture, it wouldn't occur to kids to question or talk back to their parents. In American culture, kids in books, TV shows and movies constantly score points with their snappy back talk. Typically, it's the parents who need to be taught a life lesson - by their children.","[life, children, culture]",movies
18,Anna Kendrick,"I'm into 'The Walking Dead,' 'Shaun of the Dead,' obviously, and I've seen all the Romero movies. I am a classic zombie queen. And I love the White Walkers on 'Game of Thrones.' Weirdly, it wasn't until pretty late in life that I found my entry point into horror films.","[life, love, i am]",movies
19,Trent Reznor,"I wanted to escape Small Town U.S.A. To dismiss the boundaries, to explore. My life experience came from watching movies, TV, and reading books and magazines. When your culture comes from watching TV everyday, you're bombarded with images of things that seem cool, places that seem interesting, people who have jobs and careers and opportunities.","[life, experience, culture]",movies
20,Eddie Redmayne,"I always try to describe making movies like summer camp, or some holiday where you spend all day, every day with a new group of people whom you kind of love and then never see again.","[love, holiday, day]",movies
21,Dwayne Johnson,"I like the idea of working in different genres and transcending genres and hopefully finding success, and ultimately make movies people like.","[success, people, finding]",movies
22,Helen Mirren,"It'll be the Internet and piracy that will kill film. There's a philosophy that the Internet should be free, but the reality is that piracy will destroy the film industry and film as an art form because it's expensive to make a movie. Maybe you'll have funky little independent movies, and it'll go back and then start up again some other way.","[art, philosophy, internet]",movies
23,Gerard Way,"I had a couple of really cool friends when I was a kid, and we'd find cool music and movies and show them to each other. My friend Dennis had a copy of 'A Clockwork Orange' and he'd already seen it once, and he was like, 'We need to watch this.' I was sleeping over his house - and I think we were literally 15 - and we watched it.","[music, cool, friends]",movies
24,Elvis Presley,"When I was a boy, I always saw myself as a hero in comic books and in movies. I grew up believing this dream.","[hero, myself, dream]",movies
