0,Catherine Hardwicke,"I could go my whole life and say, 'I'm not going to do anything with a love triangle,' but whenever you have a romance, there has to be some obstacle, and even the dumbest romantic comedies have a love triangle or something.","[life, love, you]",romantic
1,Jade Jagger,"My personal style changes wherever I am. When I'm in Ibiza, I'm a bit girlier because there's an opportunity to be more romantic and dress up for the beach scene. Whereas in New York, I tend to go for suiting and tailoring that almost feels like weaponry for the city - but I think I'm quite playful no matter what.","[opportunity, i am, beach]",romantic

10,Kristen Stewart,"I think romance is anything honest. As long as it's honest, it's so disarming.","[think, long, honest]",romantic
11,Christina Ricci,"My dream role would probably be a psycho killer, because the whole thing I love about movies is that you get to do things you could never do in real life, and that would be my way of vicariously experiencing being a psycho killer. Also, it's incredibly romantic.","[life, love, dream]",romantic
12,Hugo Weaving,"I don't think I'll ever escape the fact that I don't belong anywhere in particular. I've often dreamed about going back to Nigeria, but that's a very romantic notion. It's a hideous country to go to in reality.","[reality, think, escape]",romantic

17,Steve Martin,"I think I meant that, given the circumstances of my childhood, I had the illusion that it's easier to be alone.

You know, I was raised on the idea of the ramblin' man and the loner.","[alone, childhood, man]",romantic
18,Mindy Kaling,"I have such a rich fantasy life, I can't help it. I do make up a lot of romantic stories in my head.","[life, help, rich]",romantic
19,Julie Delpy,I had to trick people into giving me money for my first film. Making a romantic comedy is easier and more expected from a woman than it is to make a drama about a Japanese warrior.,"[money, giving, woman]",romantic
20,Taylor Lautner,I hope that I would be considered romantic. I don't know... one of my favorite movies is 'The Notebook' so I guess that would be considered romantic.

21,Jane Campion,"I think that the romantic impulse is in all of us and that sometimes we live it for a short time, but it's not part of a sensible way of living.
