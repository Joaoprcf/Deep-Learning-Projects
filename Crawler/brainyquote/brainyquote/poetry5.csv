0,Maya Angelou,"I wrote some of the worst poetry west from the Mississippi River, but I wrote. And I finally sometimes got it right.","[river, sometimes, worst]",poetry
1,Maya Angelou,"I know some people might think it odd - unworthy even - for me to have written a cookbook, but I make no apologies. The U.S. poet laureate Billy Collins thought I had demeaned myself by writing poetry for Hallmark Cards, but I am the people's poet so I write for the people.","[myself, i am, writing]",poetry
2,Jason Mraz,"I recently read that it's the left brain that does all that calculating, and the right brain that does the poetry. Somehow I've veered way towards the left. I've been doing it for years. Maybe I do art to balance it out.","[art, balance, brain]",poetry
3,P. J. O'Rourke,"It could be that all awful dictators are frustrated artists - Mao with his poetry and Mussolini with his monuments. Stalin was once a journalistic hack, and I can personally testify to how frustrated they are. Pol Pot left a very edgy photo collection behind. And Osama seems quite interested in video.","[i can, behind, video]",poetry
4,Maya Angelou,"I find in my poetry and prose the rhythms and imagery of the best - I mean, when I'm at my best - of the good Southern black preachers. The lyricism of the spirituals and the directness of gospel songs and the mystery of blues are in my music or in my poetry and prose, or I missed everything.","[music, best, good]",poetry
5,Maya Angelou,"Human beings love poetry. They don't even know it sometimes... whether they're the songs of Bono, or the songs of Justin Bieber... they're listening to poetry.","[love, listening, know]",poetry
6,Maya Angelou,"I've always written. There's a journal which I kept from about 9 years old. The man who gave it to me lived across the street from the store and kept it when my grandmother's papers were destroyed. I'd written some essays. I loved poetry, still do. But I really, really loved it then.","[man, me, loved]",poetry
7,Maya Angelou,"I'm happy to be a writer - of prose, poetry, every kind of writing. Every person in the world who isn't a recluse, hermit or mute uses words. I know of no other art form that we always use.","[art, happy, writing]",poetry
8,Rhys Ifans,"When you act, you've got to be like a poet or a musician. It's not about evidence before court. It's not a forensic subject. It's poetry; it's a completely different place.","[place, you, court]",poetry
9,Mike Leigh,"The whole thing about making films in an organic film on location is that it's not all about characters, relationships and themes, it's also about place and the poetry of place. It's about the spirit of what you find, the accidents of what you stumble across.","[find, place, you]",poetry

14,Allen Ginsberg,"Poetry is not an expression of the party line. It's that time of night, lying in bed, thinking what you really think, making the private world public, that's what the poet does.","[time, thinking, night]",poetry
15,Carl Sandburg,"When I was writing pretty poor poetry, this girl with midnight black hair told me to go on.","[writing, black, girl]",poetry
16,Vincent Van Gogh,"Poetry surrounds us everywhere, but putting it on paper is, alas, not so easy as looking at it.","[looking, easy, paper]",poetry
17,Ryan Adams,Music is my thing. It's my thing; it's what I love. It's what I do. It's football to me; it's Christmas to me; religion to me; poetry to me.,"[christmas, love, music]",poetry
18,Bob Dylan,It's not easy to define poetry.,"[easy, define]",poetry
19,Muriel Rukeyser,"If there were no poetry on any day in the world, poetry would be invented that day. For there would be an intolerable hunger.","[day, world, hunger]",poetry
20,Robert Louis Stevenson,Wine is bottled poetry.,"[food, wine, bottled]",poetry
21,Seamus Heaney,"In fact, in lyric poetry, truthfulness becomes recognizable as a ring of truth within the medium itself.","[truth, within, ring]",poetry
22,Leonard Cohen,"Poetry is just the evidence of life. If your life is burning well, poetry is just the ash.","[life, evidence, well]",poetry
23,Niels Bohr,"When it comes to atoms, language can be used only as in poetry. The poet, too, is not nearly so concerned with describing facts as with creating images.","[language, facts, images]",poetry
