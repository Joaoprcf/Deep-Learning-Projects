1,Dmitry Medvedev,Legal reform in Russia is a must. And I keep track of it daily.,"[daily, reform, russia]",legal
2,Paul LePage,"I believe if an individual wants to join organized labor and work under a union contract, they should have the legal right to do so. At the same token, a person who does not want to work under organized labor and wants to work should have the ability to do so without the threat of having to join and having to pay dues to organized labor.","[work, believe, want]",legal
3,Jack Kingston,"Frivolous lawsuits are booming in this county. The U.S. has more costs of litigation per person than any other industrialized nation in the world, and it is crippling our economy.","[world, economy, nation]",legal
4,Jeh Johnson,"In my view, targeted lethal force is at its least controversial when it is on its strongest, most traditional legal foundation. The essential mission of the U.S. military is to capture or kill an enemy. Armies have been doing this for thousands of years. As part of a congressionally authorized armed conflict, the foundation is even stronger.","[conflict, enemy, foundation]",legal
5,Jeh Johnson,"Under well-settled legal principles, lethal force against a valid military objective, in an armed conflict, is consistent with the law of war and does not, by definition, constitute an 'assassination.'","[war, conflict, law]",legal
6,John Yoo,"Human-rights advocates, for example, claim that the mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners is of a piece with President Bush's 2002 decision to deny al Qaeda and Taliban fighters the legal status of prisoners of war under the Geneva Conventions.","[war, decision, example]",legal
7,John Yoo,The effort to blur the lines between Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib reflects a deep misunderstanding about the different legal regimes that apply to Iraq and the war against al Qaeda.,"[war, deep, effort]",legal
8,John Yoo,"While Taliban fighters had an initial claim to protection under the conventions, they lost POW status by failing to obey the standards of conduct for legal combatants: wearing uniforms, a responsible command structure, and obeying the laws of war.","[war, lost, obey]",legal
9,John Yoo,"Once the attacks occur, as we learned on Sept. 11, it is too late. It makes little sense to deprive ourselves of an important, and legal, means to detect and prevent terrorist attacks while we are still in the middle of a fight to the death with al Qaeda.","[death, fight, late]",legal
10,Edwin Meese,A written constitution guides and directs the application of law in a way utterly unlike oral guidance. It reminds us that the certainty and consistency of legal application is essential.,"[constitution, law]",legal
11,Caleb Cushing,"Upon the Constitution, upon the pre-existing legal rights of the People, as understood in this country and in England, I have argued that this House is bound to revive the Petition under debate.","[constitution, people, debate]",legal

14,Jan de Bont,"In regards to The Haunting, people compared it to the old movie, which is unfair. We didn't have the rights to the movie. I couldn't duplicate a single thing because that would have been legal infringement.","[people, rights, unfair]",legal
15,Lisa Scottoline,"Truly I never thought of myself as writing legal thrillers, and I still don't think I do. I write stories about women.","[women, myself, writing]",legal
16,Martin Bashir,It was not possible to broadcast any of that because of an agreement between Jackson and the family. Our legal advice was that we could not broadcast it.,"[family, advice, possible]",legal
17,Alan Huffman,"The Singaporean government, which represents legal migrant workers in employment disputes and claims of exploitation, requires that they stay in the country until the disputes are settled. If they leave, their claims are closed.","[government, country, leave]",legal
18,Mark Fuhrman,"I think it's pathetic that a court of law cannot be in a vacuum of the legal system, without the influence of the public threatening to do great bodily harm to people and property. It's really a pathetic statement for our country.","[great, law, influence]",legal
19,Joe Lieberman,I also urge the Obama administration - both on its own and in cooperation with other responsible governments around the world - to use all legal means necessary to shut down WikiLeaks before it can do more damage by releasing additional cables. WikiLeaks' activities represent a shared threat to collective international security.,"[world, security, cooperation]",legal

21,Nelson Algren,Literature is made upon any occasion that a challenge is put to the legal apparatus by conscience in touch with humanity.,"[humanity, challenge]",legal
22,Jan C. Ting,"If we want to set and enforce a limit on immigration, we have to be willing to say no to would-be immigrants who look a lot like our own ancestors, not because there's anything wrong with them, but simply because admitting them would exceed our legal limit.","[immigration, limit, want]",legal
23,Jan C. Ting,"The U.S. immigration system is the most generous in the world, providing each year more green cards for legal permanent residence with a clear path to full citizenship than all the rest of the nations of the world combined.","[path, world, year]",legal
