2,Gertrude Stein,"It is funny that men who are supposed to be scientific cannot get themselves to realise the basic principle of physics, that action and reaction are equal and opposite, that when you persecute people you always rouse them to be strong and stronger.","[strong, men, people]",funny

8,Michael Buble,"I am a candid interview and I have a dark and dry sense of humor - a very Canadian sense of humor and I am only learning now stupidly that you can't read tongue.

12,Jonah Hill,"'Funny People' is my favorite performance of myself to date. Even though it's a comedy and there are serious moments, I really felt like Leo felt like a real person. It didn't feel like I was playing myself. Whether it's a comedy or drama, I just try to make it as realistic as possible.","[myself, people, moments]",funny

19,Louie Anderson,"I had been asking the universe and God to send me a way for me to help me. Show business has been so wonderful to me, and it came in the form of that.
