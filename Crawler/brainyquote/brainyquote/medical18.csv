0,Don Lemon,"I know that some things are beyond our control, some illnesses are beyond our control, we get sick, we don't know why. But let's pledge to do whatever we can to avoid those high medical bills.","[control, sick, know]",medical
1,Siddhartha Mukherjee,"There is an enormous amount of options that a physician can provide today, right down from curing patients, treating patients, or providing patients with psychic solace or pain relief. So, in fact, the gamut of medical intervention is enormous.","[today, pain, physician]",medical
2,Siddhartha Mukherjee,"A strong intuition is much more powerful than a weal test. Normals teach us rules; outliers teach us laws. For every perfect medical experiment, there is a perfect human bias.","[strong, rules, perfect]",medical
3,Anton Chekhov,"Doctors are just the same as lawyers; the only difference is that lawyers merely rob you, whereas doctors rob you and kill you too.","[lawyers, you, same]",medical
4,Gina Raimondo,"I'll bring colleges and industry together to develop new products in marine science, green technology, and medical devices, and to train our workers to fill those jobs... We need to get Rhode Islanders back to work.","[work, technology, science]",medical
5,Indra Nooyi,"The medical system in the United States is among the best in the world, if not the best. What if we were to make the United States a medical destination? That would bring a lot of people here because there are a lot of sick people around the world. If they can get U.S. treatment, they will take it, but now think about what that will do.","[best, destination, world]",medical
6,Khaled Hosseini,"I entered the literary world, really, from outside. My entire background has been in sciences; I was a biology major in college, then went to medical school. I've never had any formal training in writing.","[college, school, training]",medical
7,Khaled Hosseini,"I will say that there is an inordinate amount of medicine in my novels, especially the first one. There are a lot of medical things that happen. A hip fracture, three different kinds of lung cancer, pneumonia, blood poisoning, and so on.","[medicine, happen, blood]",medical
8,Anupam Kher,"You may be in a medical or engineering college, but not all will stand first in class. It depends on who studies the most.","[college, engineering, stand]",medical
9,Sarah Shahi,I had a home birth because I really believe in the body's natural ability to give birth. The medical profession has kind of warped women's minds into thinking we don't know how to birth and we need doctors and epidurals and Pitocin.,"[home, women, believe]",medical
10,Liya Kebede,Miriam Were has made outstanding contributions to public health in the developing world. She brings basic medical services to women and children in East Africa.,"[health, women, children]",medical
11,Reese Witherspoon,"I had parents who believed I could do anything - and I know how that made me feel. I think both my parents, having careers in the medical profession, feel they are helping people on a daily basis, and that was inculcated in me as a value. I had to struggle with giving up the idea of becoming a doctor myself.","[daily, giving, myself]",medical
12,Eric Ries,"Here in Silicon Valley, I have taken part in hundreds of conversations trying to convince people to dive in and become entrepreneurs. All too often, innovators with good, safe, jobs are unwilling to put their family's access to health care at risk by walking away from company-backed medical insurance.","[family, health, good]",medical
13,Francis Collins,"I trained initially as a physical chemist, and then, after becoming interested in biology, I went to medical school and learned how to be a physician. So, I'm a physician scientist.","[school, physician]",medical
14,Francis Collins,"I think history would say that medical research has, throughout many changes of parties, remained as one of the shining lights of bipartisan agreement, that people are concerned about health for themselves, for their families, for their constituents.","[history, health, research]",medical
15,S. Jay Olshansky,I'm not sure the least educated members of the population are missing out on the advances in medical technology as much as they are adopting harmful behavioral habits that shorten their life.,"[life, technology, missing]",medical
16,S. Jay Olshansky,"The way that we are going after ageing, I think, is a problem. The modern medical model is basically designed to attack one disease at a time. Independent of all other diseases and independent of the basic process of ageing itself.","[time, problem, process]",medical
17,Bernie Siegel,I wish medical schools helped us to analyze our healthy and unhealthy reasons for becoming doctors.,"[healthy, wish, analyze]",medical
18,Claire McCaskill,"Corporate governance is a huge issue too. We don't have women on these corporate boards. More than half of the students in law school are women, more than half of the women, I think, in medical school now are women.","[women, school, law]",medical
19,Tess Gerritsen,"I was a writer first, and knew I'd be a storyteller at age seven. But since my parents are very practical, they urged me to go into a profession that would be far more secure, so I went to medical school.","[age, school, parents]",medical
20,Tess Gerritsen,"My dad was Chinese-American and very conservative when it came to his family's futures. He said if I wanted to have a secure job, I should go into science. So I did what Dad said and went to medical school, but the writing bug never left me.","[family, science, dad]",medical
21,Tess Gerritsen,"I met my husband, Jacob, in medical school. We married and went to live in Hawaii where his family lived. It was very beautiful, but I wasn't used to being on an island and needed wide open spaces. Eventually we moved to Maine, New England.","[family, beautiful, school]",medical
22,Tess Gerritsen,"I think of myself as a fairly logical, scientific and somewhat reserved person. Maura Isles, the Boston medical examiner who appears in five of my books, is me. Almost everything I use in describing her, from her taste in wine to her biographical data, is taken from my own family. Except I don't have a serial killer as a mother!","[family, myself, mother]",medical
23,Tess Gerritsen,"I think what medical training does is it gives you the language, the tools to look up facts. I think medical training gives you a sense of how to approach a problem, how to look at symptoms and go down the list of what it might be.","[training, language, problem]",medical
24,Tess Gerritsen,"Writing is very much an emotional process; it requires you to be very in touch with your feelings. That is the opposite of what you're taught as a medical doctor. We're supposed to be detached and logical. Maybe because I started off as a writer and then became a doctor, I'm able to integrate those two.","[writing, doctor, process]",medical
25,Brendan Iribe,"You put on this set of goggles, and within seconds, your brain is convinced you're now in a different, virtual environment. You're somewhere else, and that somewhere else may be a video game, it may be in a real-time movie, a museum exhibit, or a medical surgical training app.","[training, brain, environment]",medical
