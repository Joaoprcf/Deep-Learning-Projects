0,Anthony Foxx,A lot of people in the technology space love the idea of a solving a problem.,"[love, technology, people]",space
1,Suzanne Somers,"It's always good to leave a little space between eating and lying down in bed at the end of the day. The best thing to eat at night in general is protein, fat, and vegetables. For instance, if you're in an Italian restaurant, have chicken piccata with lemon-butter sauce, lots of vegetables, and a big salad. You'll sleep like a baby.","[best, good, sleep]",space
2,Buzz Aldrin,"Everyone who's been in space would, I'm sure, welcome the opportunity for a return to the exhilarating experiences there.","[opportunity, welcome]",space
3,Buzz Aldrin,My expertise is the space program and what it should be in the future based on my experience of looking at the transitions that we've made between pre-Sputnik days and getting to the moon.,"[future, experience, moon]",space
4,Buzz Aldrin,I am excited to think that the development of commercial capabilities to send humans into low Earth orbit will likely result in so many more Earthlings being able to experience the transformative power of space flight.,"[experience, power, i am]",space
5,Buzz Aldrin,"Space architectures capable of supporting a permanent human presence on Mars are extraordinarily complex, with many different interdependent systems.","[mars, capable, human]",space
6,Buzz Aldrin,"Having walked on the Moon, I know something about what we need to explore, really explore, in space.","[moon, know, something]",space
7,Buzz Aldrin,"With his deeds, not only words, President Obama has revitalized our struggling space program.","[words, deeds, president]",space
8,Buzz Aldrin,"People come up to me and say, 'It's too bad the space program got canceled.' This is not the case, and yet that is what most of the public thinks has happened.","[people, me, bad]",space
9,Pico Iyer,"In many a piece of music, it's the pause or the rest that gives the piece its beauty and its shape. And I know I, as a writer, will often try to include a lot of empty space on the page so that the reader can complete my thoughts and sentences and so that her imagination has room to breathe.","[music, beauty, imagination]",space
10,Henry Petroski,"We call the fates of the Titanic and the Concordia - as well as those of the space shuttles Challenger and Columbia - 'accidents.' Foreseeing such undesirable events is what engineers are expected to do. However, design trade-offs leave technological systems open to failings once predicted, but later forgotten.","[design, engineers]",space
11,Henry Petroski,"The space shuttle was designed, at least in part, to broaden our knowledge of the universe. To scientists, the vehicle was a tool; to engineers, it was their creation.","[knowledge, universe]",space
12,Kevin A. Ford,"The ability of the humans to not only function in space but be very functional when they arrive at their destination, those are the kinds of things we're learning from the science. Fuel transfer technologies and all the things we can learn about the space environment are all valuable to us for pressing on out.","[learning, science]",space
13,Kevin A. Ford,"Life as an astronaut in space is a very interesting one. There are things we all take for granted here on earth, like gravity, that can make things a bit challenging. One of the fun things about getting here is the zero gravity and floating around. But it also makes things very difficult.","[life, fun, take for granted]",space
14,Taylor Swift,I can't deal with someone wanting to take a relationship backward or needing space or cheating on you.,"[relationship, cheating]",space
15,John Cage,"There is no such thing as an empty space or an empty time. There is always something to see, something to hear. In fact, try as we may to make a silence, we cannot.","[time, silence, try]",space
16,Bobby Jones,Competitive golf is played mainly on a five-and-a-half-inch course... the space between your ears.,"[golf, competitive, ears]",space
17,Joel Kinnaman,"In Sweden, there's a lot of talk of gender equality. That discussion isn't as prevalent in the U.S. I feel that successful American women are tougher than Swedish women - they create their space.","[women, equality, gender]",space
18,Margaret J. Wheatley,"Circles create soothing space, where even reticent people can realize that their voice is welcome.","[welcome, people, voice]",space
19,Liam Neeson,"I always wanted to be a cowboy, and Jedi Knights are basically cowboys in space, right?","[always, right, cowboy]",space
20,Shigeru Miyamoto,There's definitely space for uniqueness in a home console.,"[home, uniqueness, console]",space
21,David Lynch,"Music deals with time and timing. It's so magical, but when you get into it, every little sound and every little space between the sounds, it's critical, so critical. And if it's not there, it not only feels wrong, but it ruins things.","[music, time, timing]",space
22,Seth MacFarlane,"Evolution doesn't care whether you believe in it or not, no more than gravity does. I want to rekindle excitement over what we've achieved as a species with the space program. We can't afford to regress back to the days of superstition.","[believe, care, evolution]",space
23,Xavier Dolan,"Cinema is a thankless industry where sometimes to appear on the cinematic scenery is a thing for late bloomers and people who are very patient. The places are accounted, and the space is often unwelcoming. Money is rare, and independent voices are muted by the almost complete absence of risk takers.","[money, risk, people]",space
24,Michael J. Massimino,"The reason we have the stars twinkle at night is because the light is being kind of blurred by the atmosphere around the Earth. That is why the Hubble Space Telescope is so good, because it is above the atmosphere. So it is kind of like looking at the sun from the bottom of a swimming pool, versus looking at the sun above the swimming pool.","[light, good, stars]",space
25,David Dobkin,"Laughter is binary: It either happens or it doesn't. As each joke arrives in the course of a film, the cavernous space of the theater is either filled with joy and laughter or with the quiet of cringing embarrassment. Every time you step to the plate to make a joke, you're going to experience one or the other.","[time, experience, joy]",space
