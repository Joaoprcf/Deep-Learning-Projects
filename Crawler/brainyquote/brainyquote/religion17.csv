1,Pete Sampras,"It's not my place to tell you whom to vote for, to take any political stand, to tell you what religion to believe in. I'm an athlete. I can influence certain things, but when I see other athletes and celebrities telling you whom to vote for, I actually get a bit offended.","[believe, influence]",religion
2,Jonathan Sacks,"Religion is the best antidote to the individualism of the consumer age. The idea that society can do without it flies in the face of history and, now, evolutionary biology.","[best, history, age]",religion
3,Tim Heidecker,"There's a generation of people I think without a strong connection to family, to religion, to civic duty. They have a real disassociation from the problems of the world.","[family, strong, generation]",religion

5,Sam Harris,"The usefulness of religion - the fact that it gives life meaning, that it makes people feel good - is not an argument for the truth of any religious doctrine. It's not an argument that it's reasonable to believe that Jesus really was born of a virgin or that the Bible is the perfect word of the creator of the universe.","[life, truth, good]",religion
6,Sam Harris,"To speak specifically of our problem with the Muslim world, we are meandering into a genuine clash of civilizations, and we're deluding ourselves with euphemisms. We're talking about Islam being a religion of peace that's been hijacked by extremists. If ever there were a religion that's not a religion of peace, it is Islam.","[peace, world, problem]",religion
7,James Frey,"America was first colonized by Puritans. Most of our earliest immigrants, and many since, have come here in order to practice their religious beliefs as they please. Our culture has always been, and will most likely always be, profoundly influenced by religion.","[culture, america, practice]",religion
8,Vanna Bonta,Atheism is a religion itself complete with fanatics and bigots.,"[atheism, complete, itself]",religion
9,Ellen G. White,"Do not neglect secret prayer, for it is the soul of religion.","[prayer, soul, secret]",religion
10,Nathan Myhrvold,"In politics, religion and other areas of culture, people disagree on the worth of competing ideas.

So conflicting ideologies persist indefinitely.","[culture, politics, world]",religion
11,Bill Nye,"You can believe what you want religiously. Religion is one thing, but science, provable science, is something else.","[science, believe, want]",religion
12,Nick Cave,"The concept of God in America is very different than it is in England. Because we see the horrendous outcome of religion as being an American thing, in which the name of God has been hijacked by a gang of psychopaths and bullies and homophobes, and the name of God has been used for their own twisted agendas.","[god, america, american]",religion
13,Steve Earle,"To me, religion is an agreement between a group of people about what God is. Spirituality is a one-on-one relationship.","[relationship, god, people]",religion

16,Ayaan Hirsi Ali,Let us recognize that we can no longer tolerate violent oppression of women in the name of religion and culture any more than we would tolerate violent oppression espoused by any other bully in the name of a twisted rationale.,"[women, culture, oppression]",religion
17,Mohamed ElBaradei,"Whether one believes in evolution, intelligent design, or Divine Creation, one thing is certain. Since the beginning of history, human beings have been at war with each other, under the pretext of religion, ideology, ethnicity and other reasons. And no civilization has ever willingly given up its most powerful weapons.","[war, history, design]",religion
18,Tom Ford,"I am a spiritual person in an eastern religion kind of way. I learned that happiness for all of us is a switch that you flick in your brain. It doesn't have anything to do with getting a new house, a new car, a new girlfriend, or a new pair of shoes. Our culture is very much about that; we are never happy with what we have today.","[happiness, happy, today]",religion
19,Neil deGrasse Tyson,"Most religious people in America fully embrace science. So the argument that religion has some issue with science applies to a small fraction of those who declare that they are religious. They just happen to be a very vocal fraction, so you got the impression that there are more of them than there actually is.","[science, america, small]",religion
20,Dalai Lama,I always say that people should not rush to change religions. There is real value in finding the spiritual resources you need in your home religion.,"[change, home, spiritual]",religion
21,Stephen Hawking,Science is increasingly answering questions that used to be the province of religion.,"[science, questions, used]",religion
22,Dinesh D'Souza,"Christianity is the fastest-growing religion in the world; Islam is the second. It's spreading in Asia, Africa, and South America. So the world is in a kind of religious revival, and the atheists are totally flummoxed. They thought they were winning, and now they see that they aren't.","[winning, america, world]",religion
23,William T. Vollmann,"My father hates organized religion, probably because he hates the God who killed his little girl back in 1968. I find religions variously bemusing.","[god, father, girl]",religion
