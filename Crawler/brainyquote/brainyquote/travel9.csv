0,James Houston,"It's hard now to imagine that kind of travel and the daily tasks they simply took for granted. If a wagon axle broke, you had to stop and carve a new one. To cross a river, you sometimes had to build a raft.","[daily, river, you]",travel
1,Geoffrey Rush,"My kids started school, so having a strong base in Melbourne has been a key priority. I'm not daunted by the travel. People say, 'It's so far to Australia,' and I say, 'You get on the plane, you eat well, you sleep, you wake up - and you're there.'","[sleep, school, strong]",travel
2,Petra Nemcova,"I grew up under Communism so we could only learn Russian, and then when Communism fell in 1989 we could learn a few more things and have the freedom to travel and the freedom of speech - and the freedom of dreaming, really.","[freedom, freedom of speech]",travel
3,Donny Robinson,"I always travel with my bike and it has become a little more difficult to do it nowadays, but I stick it in 3,5 by 6-foot case and wheel that thing in.","[bike, difficult, always]",travel
4,Maria Sharapova,"When I travel, I love speaking to women around the world about the things that inspire them, the fashions they like, what makes something good and what would make it even better.","[love, women, good]",travel
5,Cynthia Nixon,"The idea of making access to safe abortions harder and more expensive and more difficult, having to travel across state lines - that puts women's health and lives in jeopardy, which is something I think no one wants.","[health, women, difficult]",travel
6,Curtis Stone,"For 'Around the World in 80 Plates' we got to travel all over, having what was like a cross between a culinary competition and races. And in each country we had a chef Ambassador. We went to London, Barcelona, Bologna, Hong Kong, Thailand, Morocco... It was amazing.","[competition, amazing, chef]",travel
7,John Galliano,I'm passionate and I travel the world not just as a tourist but to understand cultures... I've lived with Masai tribe... I travel the world and bring it back in the form of a research book that would become the starting point for the collection.,"[book, research, world]",travel
8,Ai Weiwei,"As a person, I was born to give out my opinions. By giving out my opinions, I realize who I am. As long as I can communicate, I'm not so lonely. If I cannot travel, or do art, or have company, if they take away all my belongings, it doesn't matter at all.","[art, giving, i am]",travel
9,Manolo Blahnik,I hate to travel with stuff.,"[hate, stuff]",travel
10,Freema Agyeman,"I'm terrified of bugs and I travel with sprays, lotions, potions; the lot. I have to check the room before I go to sleep and if I come across a bug and fail to remove it I have to sleep in a separate room as I'm paranoid that I'll be taken advantage of as I sleep.","[sleep, fail, check]",travel

14,Glenn Turner,"You can get too close as a team. You need time away from each other. You change in the same dressing room, you play on the same cricket field, you stay in the same hotel, you travel in the same planes and buses. C'mon - this business of everyone holding hands and being pally is nonsense.","[change, time, business]",travel
15,Burt Rutan,"Space travel is the only technology that is more dangerous and more expensive now than it was in its first year. Fifty years after Yuri Gagarin, the space shuttle ended up being more dangerous and more expensive to fly than those first throwaway rockets, even though large portions of it were reusable. It's absurd.","[technology, year, fly]",travel
16,Laz Alonso,Being able to travel and see the world really makes me appreciate the blessings in my life. There are so many people that will never get a chance to see some of the things that I've seen during my travels. I'll never take that for granted.,"[life, blessings, world]",travel
17,Lyall Watson,"The limits of sensory evolution in fish are defined very largely by their habitat. Water is physically supportive, carries some kinds of odour well, and is kind to sound - letting it travel several times faster than air will allow, but it inhibits other more personal kinds of communication.","[communication, water, fish]",travel
18,Ann Hood,"Through the eight books in 'The Treasure Chest' series, readers will meet twins Maisie and Felix and learn the secrets and rules of time travel, where they will encounter some of these famous and forgotten people.

20,Dhani Jones,"What better way to get to know a culture than to go there and learn their sports? And I say to people who tell me they can't travel, 'How much did you spend at the mall this year? How many times did you eat out? Take that money and go.'","[money, sports, culture]",travel

22,Danielle de Niese,"In a fit at the bookstore one day, I bought all my favourite composers' biographies: Schubert, Massenet, Wolf. I've still not had a chance to read them; it breaks my heart. But when you travel so much, you just can't take that many books with you.","[heart, day, chance]",travel
23,Daniel Kahneman,"People just hate the idea of losing. Any loss, even a small one, is just so terrible to contemplate that they compensate by buying insurance, including totally absurd policies like air travel.","[hate, losing, loss]",travel
24,Maria Valverde,"I adore Madrid. It's my city. If I ever move, it will only be for work. Whenever I travel, I always want to get back home.","[work, home, city]",travel
25,Gretchen Rubin,"Nature is impersonal, awe-inspiring, elegant, eternal. It's geometrically perfect. It's tiny and gigantic. You can travel far to be in a beautiful natural setting, or you can observe it in your backyard - or, in my case, in the trees lining New York City sidewalks, or in the clouds above skyscrapers.","[nature, beautiful, clouds]",travel
