0,Kevin Hart,"Everybody wants to be famous, but nobody wants to do the work. I live by that. You grind hard so you can play hard.

7,Bill Murray,"I always want to say to people who want to be rich and famous: 'try being rich first'. See if that doesn't cover most of it.

8,Tiesto,I can read a crowd pretty well. I know what to play and know how to keep it interesting for them and for myself as well.

9,Ravi Zacharias,"Pleasure without God, without the sacred boundaries, will actually leave you emptier than before. And this is biblical truth, this is experiential truth.

15,Bo Burnham,"I think it would collapse my heart if I was super famous. I don't have the nerve for it, I'm too anxious. I don't know how you're not obsessed with how people perceive you, because they're real people, you know? You can convince yourself that they don't really know you, and that's true, but how can it not hurt your feelings?","[heart, yourself, people]",famous

24,Thomas Sangster,"I find it weird the way people get so excited about celebrity. If my friends are on the phone, their friends will say: 'Is that kid from 'Love Actually' there?'
