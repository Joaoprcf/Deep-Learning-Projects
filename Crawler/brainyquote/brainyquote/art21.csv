1,Gunter Grass,"Art is accusation, expression, passion. Art is a fight to the finish between black charcoal and white paper.","[passion, black, finish]",art
2,LL Cool J,I am a real person that cares about his art and cares about what he's doing - I have a heart and a soul and want to touch people and give.,"[heart, soul, i am]",art
3,David Blaine,Magic's an art where you use slight of hand or illusion to create wonder. And I was just intrigued with that idea.,"[magic, illusion, you]",art
4,Gianni Versace,"Even Michelangelo got paid for doing the Sistine Chapel. To those artists who say they're doing it for the love of art, I say: Get real.","[love, doing, real]",art
5,Jeff Koons,"When I view the world, I don't think of my own work. I think of my hope that, through art, people can get a sense of the type of invisible fabric that holds us all together, that holds the world together.","[work, hope, together]",art
6,Dar Williams,The funny thing is musicians often love to go to see visual art because you've got all these pictures to turn into metaphors.,"[funny, love, musicians]",art
7,Rhys Ifans,I am an artisan. I only became an artist when people watch what I do. That is when it becomes art.,"[i am, people, artist]",art
8,Louis C. K.,"To me, art supplies are always okay to buy.","[me, always, okay]",art
9,LL Cool J,Timing has a lot to with art.,"[timing, lot]",art
10,Camille Paglia,"Does art have a future? Performance genres like opera, theater, music and dance are thriving all over the world, but the visual arts have been in slow decline for nearly 40 years. No major figure of profound influence has emerged in painting or sculpture since the waning of Pop Art and the birth of Minimalism in the early 1970s.","[music, future, dance]",art
11,Jasper Johns,"There was very little art in my childhood. I was raised in South Carolina; I wasn't aware of any art in South Carolina. There was a minor museum in Charleston, which had nothing of interest in it. It showed local artists, paintings of birds.","[childhood, birds, nothing]",art
12,David Hockney,"What an artist is trying to do for people is bring them closer to something, because of course art is about sharing. You wouldn't be an artist unless you wanted to share an experience, a thought.","[experience, people, thought]",art
13,Frank Ocean,"In art, at a certain level, there is no 'better than.' It's just about trying to operate for yourself on the most supreme level, artistically, that you can and hoping that people get it. Trusting that, just because of the way people are built and how interconnected we are, greatness will translate and symmetry will be recognised.","[greatness, yourself, people]",art
14,Frank Ocean,"Whenever I think about movies, I always look at that art process as having the best of a lot of worlds. Because if you watch a great film, you have a musical element to it, not just on the scoring, but in the way that the shots are edited - that has music and rhythm and time.","[music, best, time]",art
15,Maurice Sendak,The distinctions of fine art bore me to death.,"[death, me, fine art]",art
16,Keith Haring,Art is for everybody.,[everybody],art
17,Kevin Rudd,"We are so fortunate, as Australians, to have among us the oldest continuing cultures in human history. Cultures that link our nation with deepest antiquity. We have Aboriginal rock art in the Kimberley that is as ancient as the great Palaeolithic cave paintings at Altamira and Lascaux in Europe.","[history, great, deepest]",art
18,Nicki Minaj,"I've constantly tried new things, even as a child, and have always been obsessed with pink. Now I'm just a little more ladylike and fearless. You should never feel afraid to become a piece of art. It's exhilarating.","[new things, child, pink]",art
19,Mstislav Rostropovich,"People are craving this great progress in electronics, going after computers, the Internet, etc. It's a giant progress technologically. But they must have a balance of soul, a balance for human beauty. That means art has an important role.","[beauty, great, progress]",art
20,Darren Criss,As a composer and as a musician I'm a true believer - and this is not to be overly diplomatic - I'm a believer that there's artistry in everything from a lawn gnome to a desk chair to a symphony to an Andy Warhol painting. There's art in absolutely everything.,"[painting, true, chair]",art
21,Wendell Pierce,"What thoughts are to the individual, art is to the community as a whole. That's where you reflect on who you are, who you hope to be, what you've gone through, and where you hope to go.","[hope, community, thoughts]",art
22,Jerry Saltz,"I'm noticing a new approach to art making in recent museum and gallery shows. It flickered into focus at the New Museum's 'Younger Than Jesus' last year and ran through the Whitney Biennial, and I'm seeing it blossom and bear fruit at 'Greater New York,' MoMA P.S. 1's twice-a-decade extravaganza of emerging local talent.","[focus, talent, year]",art
23,Jerry Saltz,"All of Koons's best art - the encased vacuum cleaners, the stainless-steel Rabbit (the late-twentieth century's signature work of Simulationist sculpture), the amazing gleaming Balloon Dog, and the cast-iron re-creation of a Civil War mortar exhibited last month at the Armory - has simultaneously flaunted extreme realism, idealism, and fantasy.","[best, work, war]",art
24,Jerry Saltz,Venice is the perfect place for a phase of art to die. No other city on earth embraces entropy quite like this magical floating mall.,"[earth, perfect, die]",art
25,Jerry Saltz,"When money and hype recede from the art world, one thing I won't miss will be what curator Francesco Bonami calls the 'Eventocracy.' All this flashy 'art-fair art' and those highly produced space-eating spectacles and installations wow you for a minute until you move on to the next adrenaline event.","[money, world, you]",art
