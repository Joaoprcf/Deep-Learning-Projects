0,Walter Reisch,"Don't you see what's at stake here? The ultimate aim of all science to penetrate the unknown.

2,Glenn Hoddle,I started the 1998 World Cup with Teddy Sheringham up front but always planned for Michael Owen to face Colombia in our final group game because they defended square and a quick striker would be able to exploit the space behind them.,"[world, game, face]",space
3,Gus Van Sant,"The area of teenage life is not necessarily rarefied; we've all gone through that period. It's not as rarefied as a western or a space adventure or a gangster film, but it has its own dynamic.","[life, adventure, teen]",space
4,Eugene Cernan,"We don't have the capability today to put a human being in space of any kind, shape or form, which is absolutely, totally unacceptable when we got the greatest flying machine in the world sitting down at Kennedy in a garage there with nothing to do.","[today, greatest, world]",space
5,Temple Grandin,I think that autistic brains tend to be specialized brains. Autistic people tend to be less social. It takes a ton of processor space in the brain to have all the social circuits.,"[brain, people, think]",space
6,Neil Armstrong,I'm substantially concerned about the policy directions of the space agency. We have a situation in the U.S. where the White House and Congress are at odds over what the future direction should be. They're sort of playing a game and NASA is the shuttlecock that they're hitting back and forth.,"[future, game, direction]",space
7,William Shatner,"The mysteriousness and mystique of space is such, that science fiction attempts to tantalize you by telling you a story that could possibly be out there and that's the appeal of science fiction.","[science, story, fiction]",space
8,Larry David,"Most people are completely unaware of their breath. They violate your space, they have no idea that they have halitosis.","[people, most, breath]",space
9,David Hockney,"I had always planned to make a large painting of the early spring, when the first leaves are at the bottom of the trees, and they seem to float in space in a wonderful way. But the arrival of spring can't be done in one picture.","[art, spring, painting]",space

12,Karen O,"For me, California is all about rest, relaxation, space.","[me, rest, california]",space
13,Paul Keating,"I've always held the view that great states need strategic space. I mean, George Washington took his space from George III. Britain took it from just about everybody. Russia took all of Eastern Europe. Germany's taken it from everywhere they can, and China will want its space too.","[great, want, china]",space
14,David Attenborough,"It's coming home to roost over the next 50 years or so. It's not just climate change; it's sheer space, places to grow food for this enormous horde. Either we limit our population growth or the natural world will do it for us, and the natural world is doing it for us right now.","[change, home, food]",space

16,Tony Judt,"We have responsibilities for others, not just across space but across time. We have responsibilities to people who came before us.

17,Julie Mehretu,"That's what I'm interested in: the space in between, the moment of imagining what is possible and yet not knowing what that is.","[moment, not knowing]",space

21,Bill Bryson,"An awful lot of England is slowly eroding, in ways that I find really distressing, and an awful lot of it is the hedgerows... We're reaching the point where a lot of the English countryside looks just like Iowa - just kind of open space.","[find, kind, open]",space
22,Michael Heizer,"I think size is the most unused quotient in the sculptor's repertoire because it requires lots of commitment and time. To me it's the best tool.

23,Harold Prince,"I always liked the visuals to be choice and at the same time minimalist. And, I love black boxes.

24,Gisele Bundchen,Sometimes siblings can get in each other's space.,"[sometimes, get, other]",space
