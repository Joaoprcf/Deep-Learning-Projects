1,Michael Eric Dyson,"I'm a 'tweener,' man! I couldn't march with Dr. King and them. And I'm too old to be a hip-hopper. But I've been granted honorary status in each generation... I see my tongue as a bridge over which ideas can travel back and forth.","[man, bridge, generation]",travel
2,Tom Colicchio,"I travel around and hear from so many kids. Their parents say they were always very picky but they watch the show and they want to try stuff. The show is entertainment, but I think it has done so much for the public perception of what food can be.","[food, parents, perception]",travel
3,Julian Fellowes,I always like to arrive at the airport early to enjoy breakfast and lounge about so that when I get on the plane all my travel fever has disappeared.,"[breakfast, enjoy, early]",travel
4,Rita Dove,I think that you certainly don't have to be aged and travel the world to write a poem.,"[world, think, you]",travel
5,Rory Bremner,"I love anywhere new and different. That's the fun of travel. I've always loved driving through Spain, France and Italy - sometimes in an Alfa Spider.","[love, fun, loved]",travel
6,Dominic Monaghan,"I've always traveled, as a kid my parents moved me around, a different place in Germany every four years. But I got the travel bug when I was a kid, living in different countries.","[parents, me, living]",travel
7,Alex Honnold,Big climbs energize me. It's all the other aspects of being a pro-climber that wear me down. The travel and expeditions and training can become pretty tiring. But the actual big climbs - that's what I live for.,"[training, me, live]",travel
8,Charlize Theron,I grew up in South Africa and I would look at maps and we were at the bottom of the world. There was this whole thing up there. I was always reading encyclopedias about the world. So travel was something I was always attracted to.,"[reading, world, look]",travel
9,Hanna Rosin,"Every congresswoman surely endures the same strains that drive some of her male colleagues to have affairs: lots of travel, families far away, heady work that makes a domestic routine seem distant and boring. But the stakes are much higher for women, because they are still judged by a different standard.","[work, women, colleagues]",travel
10,Katrina Kaif,"I'm not a big spender or shopper. Neither am I extravagant, nor do I have big expenses. I mainly spend on travel. I don't buy overpriced clothes, as I feel such expenses are unnecessary. I probably wouldn't buy expensive watches or jewellery either.","[clothes, feel, watches]",travel
11,Hannibal Buress,"Once you're in a room like '30 Rock,' it's a creative setting, so you write more even after you go home, just because you're still in that mode of coming up with jokes. So the job wasn't sapping standup jokes, but it was sapping stand up time and energy, and I wouldn't be able to travel as much.","[time, home, stand up]",travel
12,Andrew Luck,The Nike Fuel Band is interesting - it measures your movements and how far you've walked and how hard you've worked that day. I prefer using when I travel. It's a fun way to see how far I've walked - how many steps I've taken when I'm walking around different cities.,"[day, fun, walking]",travel
13,Bill Engvall,I travel fairly lightly because you have to these days. I always take a laptop and an iPod so I can watch movies and listen to music. And my Gameboy. That's a good time-killer.,"[music, good, listen]",travel
14,Ingmar Bergman,I hate to travel. I don't go anywhere.,"[hate, go, anywhere]",travel

16,Colm Toibin,"In my 20s, as I began to travel in Europe, I found comfort in religious paintings. Even though my own belief in Catholic dogma had been shaken and weakened, I found that the beauty and the richness of the art still held me.","[beauty, art, me]",travel
17,Stacey D'Erasmo,"The railroads needed standardized time; as a result, the technology of train travel shaped the way everyone gets up, eats, goes to sleep, calculates age, and, perhaps of no small importance, imagine the world as a whole, ticking reliably, with reliable deviations, according to the beat of one central clock in a physical location.","[time, technology, age]",travel
18,Chief Joseph,"Let me be a free man - free to travel, free to stop, free to work.","[work, man, me]",travel

20,Amanda Lindhout,"Because travel has always been such a vital part of myself and so essential to who I am, I have made the decision to continue to put myself back out into the world. And that's not an easy decision to make.","[myself, i am, world]",travel
21,Amanda Lindhout,"Getting on a plane is hard for me, but I do it, because travel is vital to me.","[me, because, hard]",travel
22,Robyn Davidson,"The truth is I'm not really interested in travel writing as it's generally conceived, and even less so in female travel writing.","[truth, writing, less]",travel
23,Queen Rania of Jordan,"As a child I sometimes used to travel to the West Bank to visit my family, so I know what the checkpoints felt like. I knew what it was like to live under occupation.","[family, child, live]",travel
24,Lisa Randall,"Travel at faster than the speed of light certainly can have dramatic implications that are difficult to understand, such as time travel.","[time, light, difficult]",travel
25,Kyle MacLachlan,"I try to travel as light as possible to avoid baggage issues. Los Angeles airport is notorious for baggage delays, so I'll often FedEx a suitcase ahead or back so I don't need to stand around; it also minimises problems at check-in.","[light, stand, problems]",travel
