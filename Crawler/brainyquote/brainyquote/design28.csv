0,Frank Gehry,"There are people who design buildings that are not technically and financially good, and there are those who do. Two categories - simple.","[good, simple, people]",design
1,Nicole Richie,When we were in the design studio I always was pretending like I was in a closet asking my friend before I step out into the world what do I look like? And everybody wants that honest friend before they go and go to dinner or go to an event.,"[world, step, dinner]",design
2,Nicole Richie,"I am extremely involved in the design process of both my brands, Winter Kate and House of Harlow 1960.","[winter, i am, process]",design
3,Colleen Atwood,"The reward is that you can actually create a world separate from reality with a story, actors, music, and camera design. When it works it can entertain, move people and teach us all.","[music, world, people]",design
4,Rob Manuel,"Keep it simple, stupid. Good game design shouldn't keep you looking at the manual but should have enough depth where you feel like you bring something new to the game every time you play.","[time, good, simple]",design
5,Colleen Atwood,"The exposure I have had to beautiful materials across the world, from Japan to Italy, enables me to pull design ideas together. This, combined with years of historical research, has created a great fountain of ideas for me.","[great, beautiful, together]",design
6,Colleen Atwood,I don't design my own clothes. It's so not what I think about.,"[think, clothes, my own]",design
7,Colleen Atwood,"For contemporary fashion, I'm a huge fan of so many of the people out there. I think Azzedine Alaia holds up through three generations of very specific, beautiful design. I think Jean Paul Gaultier also is very interesting with a long span.","[beautiful, people, fashion]",design
8,Colleen Atwood,"I worked in fashion, but I worked more in the sales side of fashion than in design.

9,Colleen Atwood,"I think that sometimes people don't understand that a costume that has to be worn every day and doesn't change the whole movie becomes iconic. It's very important because it requires a different design process, since you have to make something that people aren't going to get tired of looking at.","[change, day, people]",design
10,Colleen Atwood,"I grew up in a small town in Washington State, so I wasn't really aware of costume design as a career growing up, but I loved clothes.

But I have always had a strange connection with clothing.","[money, parents, small]",design

12,Colleen Atwood,"One thing about costume design - and I think design in general - but especially costume design, is people have a misconception that it's very glamorous work.","[work, people, think]",design
13,Colleen Atwood,My own style is pretty classic; I much prefer to design for others.,"[style, others, pretty]",design
14,Colleen Atwood,"Costume design allows you to do a different type of research and create characters, whereas in fashion, you create an image and clothing for the masses.","[research, fashion, you]",design
15,Colleen Atwood,"I design for the movie and the character as well as the person wearing the costume. I show the ideas to the actor, then do fittings for shape and technical things such as movement in the costume. Once the costume in this form is on the actor, you have a sense of their connection with it. I then take it to the next level with the final fit.","[character, ideas, actor]",design
16,Colleen Atwood,I really don't over-theorize about design. I'd rather feel it than talk it to death. A lot happens as you unroll the design.,"[death, you, feel]",design
17,Edgardo Osorio,"When I sit down and design, it's shoes that always appear.","[shoes, down, always]",design
18,Edgardo Osorio,"I design flats like I design heels: They must be seductive, beautiful and comfortable.","[beautiful, heels]",design
19,Edgardo Osorio,"Being inspired is one thing, but completely knocking off a design is another. There is a big difference.","[difference, big, inspired]",design
20,Edgardo Osorio,"Sometimes you design a shoe, and you think this one is a winner, but you never know when something will be such a crazy phenomenon.","[crazy, winner, know]",design
21,Francis Collins,Proponents of intelligent design don't accept that some of the very complex nanomachines that we have inside ourselves could have come about solely on the basis of natural selection.,"[intelligent, accept, inside]",design
22,Joshua Foer,"No one who set out to design a form of communication would ever end up with anything like English, Mandarin, or any of the more than six thousand languages spoken today.","[communication, today, end]",design
23,Malorie Blackman,"I think fan fiction is the way most writers start, and the same goes for music and design.","[music, start, fiction]",design

25,Jane Seymour,"I learn my lines while on the golf course. I try to do two or three things at once. I have ideas for books all the time, I have ideas for paintings all the time, and I write them all down. I take my sketchpad and my iPad, which I design on, and I do sit down and do specific tasks at specific times.","[time, golf, ideas]",design
