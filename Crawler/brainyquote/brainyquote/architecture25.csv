1,Sammy Cahn,"Every song, the title dictates the architecture of the song.","[song, every, title]",architecture
2,Ross Lovegrove,"I'm involved in everything from highly progressive lighting systems to airline interiors. In the field of transportation I can go from the micro to the macro: architecture, transportation, industrial product design, right across the board. It's Russian dollism, because they all interrelate: one goes into the other.","[design, transportation]",architecture
3,Joshua Prince-Ramus,"Architects have created this fake separation between creation and execution. You can see it in architecture schools, where the students look down on going to contracts classes.","[fake, execution, look]",architecture
4,Joshua Prince-Ramus,Some people think architecture is about the genius sketch; I don't. Great architecture is a collaboration among a lot of people over a long period of time.,"[time, great, people]",architecture
5,Joshua Prince-Ramus,Working off one genius sketch is not the way great architecture should be made.,"[great, genius, way]",architecture
6,Joshua Prince-Ramus,Architecture is by definition a very collaborative process.,"[process, definition, very]",architecture
7,James Rouse,"For many years, I have lived uncomfortably with the belief that most planning and architectural design suffers for lack of real and basic purpose. The ultimate purpose, it seems to me, must be the improvement of mankind.","[planning, improvement]",architecture
8,Christian de Portzamparc,"We need to rediscover the essence of the meaning of 'the use.' Architecture is, above all, here for a better living. Every gesture, every shape must be justified by various reasons that would reinforce their reason to be, their use, and will give more sense to their beauty.","[beauty, living, meaning]",architecture
9,Christian de Portzamparc,"Architecture has a strong link with the movies in terms of time progression, sequencing, framing, all of that.","[time, strong, movies]",architecture
10,Christian de Portzamparc,"When I was 18, I lived in Greenwich Village, New York, for nine months. At that time, I wanted to change the world, not through architecture, but through painting. I lived the artist's life, mingling with poets and writers, and working as a waiter. I was intrigued by the aliveness of the city.","[life, change, time]",architecture
11,Christian de Portzamparc,"In the '60s when I was a student, there was this campaign to destroy 75 percent of the old buildings in Paris, replacing them with modern architecture. I realized this as a dangerous utopia. This modern vision did not understand the richness of the city. Thankfully, such destruction did not happen.","[vision, student, city]",architecture
12,Saul Steinberg,The frightening thought that what you draw may become a building makes for reasoned lines.,"[thought, building, you]",architecture
13,Bernard Levin,What has happened to architecture since the second world war that the only passers-by who can contemplate it without pain are those equipped with a white stick and a dog?,"[war, dog, pain]",architecture
14,James Polshek,"I had it drummed into me from an early age that personalizing everything was not a good thing. Besides, I don't think that kind of commodity-driven system makes for the most productive architecture.","[age, good, me]",architecture
15,James Polshek,I went into architecture a little as 'Peck's Bad Boy.' It allowed me to be a critic in a socially condoned way.,"[me, way, bad boy]",architecture
16,James Polshek,"I don't think architecture should be considered as an art form in the first instance. Whenever I say that, it makes people really angry. But this is a very political profession in the Grecian sense. I believe there have to be reasons for every building, and that the ideas should not be self-referential.","[art, believe, political]",architecture
17,James Polshek,"I've always seen architecture as a healing art, not just as a beautification art.","[art, healing, always]",architecture
18,Ben van Berkel,"My mother took me to Venice one time and showed me all the houses where famous composers used to live. It gave me a fascination for music and the city, but also for architecture. It was a valuable lesson.","[music, time, mother]",architecture
19,John Lautner,"To me, architecture is an art, naturally, and it isn't architecture unless it's alive. Alive is what art is. If it's not alive, it's dead, and it's not art.","[art, me, dead]",architecture
20,Mitchell Kapor,Architecture is politics.,[politics],architecture
21,Donald Barthelme,"My mother studied English and drama at the University of Pennsylvania, where my father studied architecture. She was a great influence in all sorts of ways, a wicked wit.","[father, great, mother]",architecture

23,Edwin Lutyens,There will never be great architects or architecture without great patrons.,"[great, will, without]",architecture
24,Edwin Lutyens,"In architecture, Palladio is the game. It means hard thought all through - if it is labored, it fails.","[thought, game, through]",architecture
25,Gates McFadden,"I love a lot of things, and I'm pretty much obsessive about most things I do, whether it be gardening, or architecture, or music. I'd be an obsessive hairdresser.","[love, music, gardening]",architecture
