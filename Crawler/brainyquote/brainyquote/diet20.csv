0,Zac Goldsmith,"A number of countries around the world, and indeed the E.U. as a whole, have chosen not to allow the import from the U.S. of beef from cows fed a diet that includes the hormone ractopamine, because of the fairly grave health concerns.","[health, world, number]",diet
1,Jason Moran,I kind of want to get the music back on a road it hasn't been on for a while. I want to promote the arts as part of the American diet.,"[music, road, american]",diet
2,D'Brickashaw Ferguson,"When the season ends, I like to take a little time off from the diet I follow when I'm playing.","[time, season, follow]",diet
3,Arabella Weir,"Statistically, if you have ever dieted you are extremely likely not only to regain any weight you lose, but to go on to gain even more. Dieting makes you fat.","[fat, you, lose]",diet
4,Arabella Weir,"In the 20 long, hungry years between my late teens and late 30s I bought in to virtually every new diet and/or exercise regime that hoved into view, particularly at this most vulnerable time for those of us prone to poor body image - a new year.","[time, year, exercise]",diet
5,Steve-O,"Almost as soon as I went vegan, people started telling me that my skin looked great, and that I appeared younger, slimmer, and healthier. I'm convinced that of all the changes I've made to my lifestyle, it's the adoption of a vegan diet that has been best for me - physically, mentally, and certainly spiritually.","[best, great, people]",diet
6,Steve-O,"I have been really enjoying making a project out of seeking out an extremely healthy diet of raw, organic, vegan foods - and I plan on continuing to do so.","[plan, healthy, project]",diet
7,Barry Humphries,"I never thought that I would become a staple in the Australian cultural diet. The equivalent of bread or milk, or a fine old Tasmanian Mauve Vein. I think it's because I talk about things that people dare not mention. I don't mean raunchy things or unsavoury things. I call a spade a spade - I discuss things in a realistic manner.","[people, thought, think]",diet
8,Carl Honore,"We're so marinated in the culture of speed that we almost fail to notice the toll it takes on every aspect of our lives - on our health, our diet, our work, our relationships, the environment and our community.","[work, health, community]",diet

Not surprisingly, this fast-forward culture is taking a toll on everything from our diet and health to our work and the environment.","[work, health, age]",diet
10,Carl Honore,"Our obsession with speed, with cramming more and more into every minute, means that we race through life instead of actually living it. Our health, diet and relationships suffer. We make mistakes at work. We struggle to relax, to enjoy the moment, even to get a decent night's sleep.","[life, work, health]",diet
11,Julie Klausner,"This is not what anyone wants to hear, just like somebody who wants to lose weight doesn't want to hear 'diet and exercise,' but I think giving yourself time and abstaining from interaction is the only way to get over somebody.","[time, giving, yourself]",diet
12,Julie Klausner,"A relationship book I once read told women to use the word 'fun' whenever possible. The author claimed it had a subliminal aphrodisiac effect on men, who want a relaxed girl attached only to good times - the human equivalent of Diet Coke. This is not me.","[relationship, women, good]",diet
13,Andrew O'Hagan,"I think I am becoming obsessive-compulsive. David Beckham apparently turns all the Diet Coke cans in his fridge to face the same way every morning, and I nerdily sharpen all the pencils in my pot before sitting down to work.","[work, morning, i am]",diet
14,Sanjeev Bhaskar,"Good diet and exercise are key, but abject fear has its own rewards. And arriving on the first day for rehearsals for 'Spamalot' and seeing all these much younger, much fitter people, who I was going to be on stage with, became a catalyst for cutting out the more unhealthy aspects of my life.","[life, fear, good]",diet
15,Larry Fitzgerald,"My diet is always extremely important to me. I've taken a new approach to eating in terms of my blood type. I really don't eat much chicken, sugar, salts, or beef. Just eating clean and feeling so much better.","[me, important, better]",diet

17,Michael Chabon,"When I was in my early to mid-teens, that was a very heavy diet of science fiction and fantasy, so those were the kinds of books I tended to imagine writing someday, or even began to try to write.","[science, writing, fiction]",diet
18,Arsene Wenger,As a coach you can influence the diet of your players. You can point out what is wrong.,"[influence, coach, you]",diet
19,Jennie Garth,"My biggest regret is putting my body through fad diets - Atkins, cleanses, the hCG diet.","[regret, body, through]",diet
20,Jai Courtney,I would much rather have a couple of hundred grams of chicken in the afternoon than neck a shake. You're better off just keeping your diet relatively lean and eating simply.,"[better, eating, you]",diet
