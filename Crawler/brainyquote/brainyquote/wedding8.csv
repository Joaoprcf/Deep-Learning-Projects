0,Letitia Baldrige,"What the bride should do is call guests who have young children and say: 'I'd love to have the kids at the wedding, but we won't have room. Would you get a baby sitter, and when we get back from our honeymoon, we'll have you guys over?'","[love, children, baby]",wedding

2,Lynn Coady,"I spent so many years in terror of 'making it legal' because the expression rang all too true - the wedding ritual struck me as nothing but a flowery front for the fulfilment of countless, tedious contracts and obligations.","[me, legal, nothing]",wedding
3,Chrissy Teigen,"I love dress shopping, and I love talking about the wedding food. That's what makes me happy. If you tell me to do a guest list, I cry. I hate it.","[love, food, happy]",wedding
4,Mira Nair,"It gave me a lot of pleasure and pride that 90 percent of the crew for 'Monsoon Wedding,' and most of my film, are women. We get the work done, you know, much lesser play of ego... And I really believe in harmony, I believe in working in a spirit of egolessness and that the film is bigger than all of us.","[work, women, believe]",wedding
5,Mira Nair,"My family is almost exactly like the one in 'Monsoon Wedding'. We are very open, fairly liberal, loud people.","[family, people, open]",wedding

7,Randeep Hooda,"Seriously I suspected I was a good actor, though I didn't know it during 'Monsoon Wedding.' Now I realize the more I learn, the less I know about acting... and life.","[life, good, learn]",wedding

9,Benedict Cumberbatch,People's hands fascinate me. It's tempting to look at a businessman's left hand and see if there's an indentation from a missing wedding ring. Or maybe there's a tan line and the skin is pressed down where's he's worked a ring off his finger.,"[people, hands, me]",wedding
10,Iris Apfel,"I used to love to create outfits, and I still do - I just don't have the time. How can you wear one thing and never wear it again?

16,Rachel McAdams,"I love auditioning. Since 'The Notebook' and 'Wedding Crashers,' I don't have to audition anymore, and I miss it. You get to show your interpretation of the character. I get nervous when I don't audition. What if they hate what I want to do?","[love, character, hate]",wedding
17,Katherine Kelly,I've already been married six times in my career as an actress - twice as Becky - so I think a wedding of my own might feel too much like work!,"[work, career, think]",wedding
18,Katherine Kelly,"I love going to other people's weddings, but I have never desired a big white wedding for myself, and it has never been put on me as a pressure, an expectation.","[love, myself, people]",wedding
19,Katherine Kelly,"So many people say you have to remember to grab hold of your bride or groom and spend time with them. I think if we had done a traditional wedding, we would have been doing it for everyone else, but this was about the two of us.","[time, people, doing]",wedding

24,Adam Sandler,"I sang a song at my sister's wedding. My mother forced me into that, too. But that one felt all right.","[mother, sister, me]",wedding
25,Gwyneth Paltrow,"I try to remember, as I hear about friends getting engaged, that it's not about the ring and it's not about the wedding. It's a grave thing, getting married. And it's easy to get swept up in the wrong things.","[friends, easy, remember]",wedding
