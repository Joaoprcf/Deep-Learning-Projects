0,Ice Cube,"Music is where I have the most creative freedom, but I love producing. To me, that's kind of where all the action is. You get a chance to have your hands in every aspect of a film. From picking a director, sometimes picking a writer, to the actors, the wardrobe, set design, editing, music, and marketing.","[love, music, freedom]",design
1,Linus Torvalds,"Hey, I'm a good software engineer, but I'm not exactly known for my fashion sense. White socks and sandals don't translate to 'good design sense'.","[good, fashion, socks]",design
2,Maria Sharapova,Ever since I was young I loved making things and being part of the design process.,"[loved, process, young]",design
3,Sophia Amoruso,"As a visual person, I love a creative resume. Putting in a little effort on the design side will show that you care about making things look good.","[love, good, effort]",design
4,Alek Wek,"I've always loved to paint - I was studying to do an art degree when I was approached to become a model - and I've being doing some design work as well. I also love just having a quiet time, sitting in my little library at home in Brooklyn and reading or watching documentaries or listening to music.","[love, music, work]",design
5,Jeffrey Kluger,"A jellyfish is little more than a pulsating bell, a tassel of trailing tentacles and a single digestive opening through which it both eats and excretes - as regrettable an example of economy of design as ever was.","[opening, economy, bell]",design
6,Dylan Lauren,"Watching my dad, Ralph Lauren, design clothes when I was young, I was always inspired.","[dad, young, clothes]",design
7,Martin Jacques,"In its heyday, the car was an expression of technical flair and design genius: the original Mini, the Beetle, the 2CV, and the Fiat 500 were all, in their various ways, inspired incarnations of functionality.","[car, genius, original]",design
8,Dylan Lauren,I love Janet Jackson and her creative set design.,"[love, creative, her]",design
9,Mitch Kapor,"The critical thing in developing software is not the program, it's the design. It is translating understanding of user needs into something that can be realized as a computer program.","[understanding, something]",design
10,Nick Harkaway,"We are bodies which think, and we're at home with steampunk because it is an ethos of design and creativity which acknowledges the humanly physical: that which we can understand with our fingers.","[home, creativity, think]",design
11,Barbra Streisand,Eighteenth century American furniture and the design of the architects Greene and Greene are my special love.,"[love, american, furniture]",design
12,Jay Samit,"Whether by design or circumstance, every startup will eventually get disrupted.","[will, every, get]",design
13,Donatella Versace,"Women are all the same; we want to be smaller in the waist, longer legs, slimmer. I design for women and their defects, to make them better.","[women, want, better]",design
14,M. J. Rose,"One of the biggest differences between you and a traditionally published author is that a self-pubbed author is responsible for everything. Not just writing the book - but cover design, editing, producing, distribution, and publicity as well.","[book, writing, differences]",design
15,Stella McCartney,"I am a fashion designer. I'm not an environmentalist. When I get up in the morning, number one I'm a mother and a wife, and number two I design clothes. So the main thing I need to do is create, hopefully, exquisitely beautiful, desirable objects for my customer.","[morning, mother, beautiful]",design
16,Stella McCartney,"My job at the end of the day is to design timeless, desirable, beautiful products. It's not about just designing a bunch of organic jumpers. I have a balance within the brand. If you try to create something people enjoy, and it happens to be made in a responsible way, then that's when you can really strike an incredible balance.","[beautiful, end, day]",design
17,Stella McCartney,I think the fact that my parents weren't conventional - especially considering their position - had a big influence on the way that I conduct myself now in design and business. It had a huge impact on my wanting to do something a bit more than just designing a pretty dress and putting it on a runway and making it glamorous.,"[business, myself, parents]",design
18,Stella McCartney,"My job is to make desirable, luxurious, beautiful clothing and accessories women want to buy. My first decision is always based on, 'Can I do this in a more sustainable way without sacrificing design?' If I can, then there is no reason not to.","[women, beautiful, job]",design
19,Dan Jenkins,"If you see a player out in public having dinner, chances are he's with his boring money manager or some boring rich guy he hopes to design a golf course for.","[money, golf, dinner]",design
20,Johnny Weir,"I design all of my costumes. I like to go out there and feel like I have contributed to every part of what I do. I choose the music, the choreographer, I've obviously chosen my coach, my costumes - all if that falls under my realm of power, my realm of influence.","[music, power, influence]",design
21,Alice Waters,"If I weren't involved with food, I'd be working in architecture. Design is that critical to me.","[food, architecture, me]",design
22,Florence Welch,I've always been a bit of a decorator. I think if I wasn't a singer I'd probably be in stage setting or interior design or something. I like clutter and I'm quite visually greedy. I can't have things to be plain; I have to have things looking interesting... maybe I'm just a frustrated interior designer stuck in a singing career.,"[looking, career, singing]",design
23,Ryan Holmes,"At the most basic level, prioritizing design also represents a practical consideration. It's far easier to design first and engineer later.","[engineer, practical, first]",design
24,Justin Cartwright,"In a way, advertising, for all its shallowness, its love of design, its modishness and its self-justification, is curiously innocent. The idea of the hidden persuader or the manipulator is largely absurd.","[love, advertising, way]",design
25,Robert Winston,"Nearly all inventions are not recognised for their positive side either when they're made. So, for example, scientists didn't go out to design a CD machine: they designed a laser. But we got all sorts of things from a laser which we never remotely imagined, and we're still finding things for a laser to do.","[positive, finding, example]",design
