0,Jane Smiley,"I learned why 'out riding alone' is an oxymoron: An equestrian is never alone, is always sensing the other being, the mysterious but also understandable living being that is the horse.","[horse, living, why]",alone
1,Marilyn Monroe,"I used to think as I looked out on the Hollywood night, 'There must be thousands of girls sitting alone like me dreaming of being a movie star.' But I'm not going to worry about them. I'm dreaming the hardest.","[night, me, worry]",alone

4,Gail Collins,"Gay rights is just a matter of time. Look at the polls. Worrying about gay marriage, let alone gay civil unions or gay employment rights, is a middle-age issue.

5,Frank Abagnale,The front of a cheque alone gives someone enough information to steal your identity.,"[identity, information]",alone
6,Ellen G. White,"Love exercised while duty is neglected will make children headstrong, willful, perverse, selfish, and disobedient.

Duty and love must be blended in order that children may be properly disciplined.","[love, children, selfish]",alone
7,Kristen Schaal,"I think growing up on a farm in a certain amount of isolation, with not a lot of friends nearby, makes you entertain yourself and kind of grows your imagination - being alone is quite good for all that.

10,Nathan Myhrvold,"Anybody who can afford a box of business cards can afford a Web site. Any company with an 800 number can move its services to the Web for peanuts by comparison. The extreme case of corporate promotion is to strip away all other aspects of your business and sell goods or services via the Net alone, as amazon.com has done with books.","[business, cards, company]",alone
11,Ramana Maharshi,"If there is anything besides the Self there is reason to fear? Who sees the second? First, the ego arises and sees objects as external. If the ego does not rise, the Self alone exists and there is no second.","[fear, self, ego]",alone

14,George Muller,"Through faith in the Lord Jesus alone can we obtain forgiveness of our sins, and be at peace with God; but, believing in Jesus, we become, through this very faith, the children of God; have God as our Father, and may come to Him for all the temporal and spiritual blessings which we need.","[peace, forgiveness, god]",alone
15,Dylan Moran,I don't watch a whole lot of stand up. Mainly I prefer to read writers; they make me laugh the most.

16,Rafael Nadal,"Being home alone at night makes me a bit nervous. If I'm at home alone, I have to sleep on the sofa - I can't face going to bed. I'm there with the TV on and all the lights on. I'm not very brave about anything in life. In tennis, yes. In everything else, not very.","[life, home, sleep]",alone

Worrying will not solve your problem.","[good, thinking, busy]",alone

22,Maya Angelou,"Politicians must set their aims for the high ground and according to our various leanings, Democratic, Republican, Independent, we will follow. Politicians must be told if they continue to sink into the mud of obscenity, they will proceed alone.","[follow, republican, mud]",alone

24,Ben Harper,"When it comes to partnership, some humans can make their lives alone - it's possible. But creatively, it's more like painting: you can't just use the same colours in every painting. It's just not an option. You can't take the same photograph every time and live with art forms with no differences.","[time, art, differences]",alone
25,Francis Ford Coppola,"I like to work in the morning. I like to sometimes go to a place where I'm all alone where I'm not going to get a phone call early that hurts my feelings, because once my feelings are hurt, I'm dead in the water.","[work, morning, water]",alone
