1,Letitia Elizabeth Landon,Society is like a large piece of frozen water; and skating well is the great art of social life.,"[life, great, water]",art
2,Marcel Duchamp,I am still a victim of chess. It has all the beauty of art - and much more. It cannot be commercialized. Chess is much purer than art in its social position.,"[beauty, i am, victim]",art

6,Nick Clegg,"My dad's side of the family had lots of artists and musicians. There's an emotional, quite sentimental quality to Slavic culture.

12,Yayoi Kusama,"With just one polka dot, nothing can be achieved. In the universe, there is the sun, the moon, the earth, and hundreds of millions of stars.

Pursuing 'philosophy of the universe' through art under such circumstances has led me to what I call 'stereotypical repetition.'","[stars, moon, sun]",art
13,Antony Gormley,"Art is the means by which we communicate what it feels like to be alive - in the past, that was mixed up with other illustrative duties, but that was still its central function that has been liberated in the art called modern.","[past, alive, modern]",art
14,Andrea Bocelli,"I don't know if One Direction will stand the test of time. I have a niece who goes crazy for them. But the only way to judge art is to wait and see if it becomes evergreen.
