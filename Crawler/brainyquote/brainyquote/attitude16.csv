0,David Byrne,"It's a fundamental, social attitude that the 1% supports symphonies and operas and doesn't support Johnny learning to program hip-hop beats. When I put it like that, it sounds like, 'Well, yeah,' but you start to think, 'Why not, though?' What makes one more valuable than another?","[learning, support, start]",attitude
1,Dean Cain,"My agent says that I'm a 'repeat business guy.' If you hire me to come do a movie, I'll be on time, know all my material, be ready to go, have a good attitude. I'm here to work, so I get hired over and over again by the same producers. If you just be a team player on set you can work so much more often.","[work, time, business]",attitude
2,Andy Cohen,"I fell in love with Erica Kane the summer before my freshman year of high school. Like all red-blooded teen American boys, I'd come home from water polo practice and eat a box of Entenmann's Pop'Ems donut holes in front of the TV while obsessively fawning over 'All My Children' and Erica, her clothes, and her narcissistic attitude.","[love, home, children]",attitude
3,Michel Houellebecq,"You can't be a crazy rebel in the face of death, it's not a fitting attitude.","[death, crazy, face]",attitude
4,Edgar Ramirez,"I think that, in the end, the military behavior and intelligence services are not very different from each other. It's an attitude of hunters; they're observing the prey.","[intelligence, end, behavior]",attitude
5,Simon Cowell,"Money brings you security and choice. You can make decisions in a different way if you have a lot of money. But when you have nothing, you have a naivety, and a more fearless attitude because you have nothing to lose.","[money, decisions, security]",attitude
6,Joe Greene,"Donald Evans is a favorite person of mine. His worth ethic, his attitude and his dedication really set him apart.","[dedication, worth, him]",attitude
7,Stacey Snider,"For 'Fright Night,' we really want to convey the fun attitude of the movie and show the intensity of Colin Farrell as a predator. He's not a brooding vampire - he's dark and dangerous.","[fun, night, dark]",attitude
8,Steven Adler,"I want to be in the big show, and to be in the big show, you have to practice. I have this attitude now that I'm going to take all the greatness I can. Nothing's going to stop me.","[greatness, me, practice]",attitude

11,Sarah Parish,"I'd love to look like my mum when I am her age. She taught ballet for years, and my attitude to exercise and fitness has definitely been influenced by her.

That's my attitude about musical philosophy.","[love, philosophy, me]",attitude
14,Eartha Kitt,"A lot can be said with just a look, or the way the body moves. Each song is a different character. So each song takes on a different movement of the body. And the body has to go with the subject and the attitude that you have toward that subject.","[character, body, said]",attitude
15,Kim Cattrall,"Have you seen some of the women - and the men - in Los Angeles? They pay surgeons to make them look completely different in the hope of finding their youth. But youth comes from within. If you have a young attitude, then that can show in your face, the way you walk and move.","[hope, women, men]",attitude
16,Juliana Hatfield,"From the beginning, I've always had a knack for catchy melodies. But I went through a period when I was trying to be rock n' roll and have a rock n' roll attitude. I was fighting my nature by trying to play really hard and sing really hard. But at a certain point, I realized that I loved syrupy pop music with tons of harmony.","[music, nature, beginning]",attitude
17,Lisa Ann Walter,"If wearing the Spanx helps you get looks, and you feel that energy and response, and you're rocking your body with confidence, that's still how you'll feel about yourself when you get home and take the Spanx off... If your attitude improves from the Spanx, wear the Spanx!","[home, confidence, yourself]",attitude
18,Megan Hilty,"I totally let myself indulge, but I make little deals with myself. If I have an extra cupcake, I'll run a couple of extra miles.

19,Richie Allen,"I'd like to get out of Philadelphia. I don't care for the people or their attitude, although they don't bother me or my play. But maybe the Phillies can get a couple of broken bats and shower shoes for me.","[shoes, people, me]",attitude
