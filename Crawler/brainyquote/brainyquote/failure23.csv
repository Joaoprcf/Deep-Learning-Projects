0,Javier Bardem,There is no middle ground in Hollywood; you're a failure or you're a success. That mentality is wild.,"[success, you, hollywood]",failure
1,Trent Reznor,"I realized that I was afraid to really, really try something, 100%, because I had never reached true failure.","[true, afraid, try]",failure
2,Betty White,"If you get into a Broadway show and it doesn't work, you're a failure. And if it does work, you may be stuck for who knows how long. It just doesn't sound great to me!","[work, great, me]",failure
3,Marsha Norman,At the heart of the failure of most plays is the inability to carry on a thoughtful conversation about your work with yourself.,"[work, heart, yourself]",failure
4,Henry Petroski,Case studies of failure should be made a part of the vocabulary of every engineer so that he or she can recall or recite them when something in a new design or design process is suggestive of what went wrong in the case study.,"[design, she, process]",failure
5,Will Self,This is the paradox for me: in failure alone is there any possibility of success. I don't think I'm alone in this - nor do I think it's an attitude that only prevails among people whose work is obviously 'creative'.,"[success, work, attitude]",failure
6,Erland Josephson,A man obsessed with failure has succeeded better than others in portraying it.,"[man, better, others]",failure
7,Chris Zylka,My greatest fear is failure.,"[fear, greatest]",failure
8,Rouben Mamoulian,"The world today is so full of violence, obscenity, war, the failure of political systems. I try to make movies that make people a bit more confident. But that doesn't mean being sugary.","[war, today, violence]",failure
9,Douglas Fairbanks,"In taking stock of ourselves, we should not forget that fear plays a large part in the drama of failure. That is the first thing to be dropped. Fear is a mental deficiency susceptible of correction, if taken in hand before it gains an ascendency over us. Fear comes with the thought of failure.","[fear, thought, forget]",failure
10,Marjane Satrapi,"If it's a good work of adaptation, the book should remain a book and the film should remain a film, and you should not necessarily read the book to see the film. If you do need that, then that means that it's a failure. That is what I think.","[work, good, book]",failure
11,Nick Frost,"Someone once pulled me aside and said it was all right to succeed, and I realised that I knew what failure felt like, but I didn't know what success felt like. I've carried that with me ever since.","[success, me, succeed]",failure
12,Tullian Tchividjian,What is indisputable is the fact that unbelief is the force that gives birth to all of our bad behavior and every moral failure. It is the root.,"[behavior, moral, bad]",failure
13,Laura Fraser,"When I was 18, I couldn't wait to move away. I was like: 'If I ever have to come back here, I'll kill myself.' Glasgow seemed like failure and death to me back then, but not any more.","[death, myself, me]",failure
14,Francis Ford Coppola,The only TV I would be interested in exploring would be live television. There's no substitute for a team of artists performing at their peak live when failure is possible. It's a high-wire act. That excites me.,"[team, me, live]",failure
15,Joyce Carol Oates,I'm drawn to failure. I feel like I'm contending with it constantly in my own life.,"[life, feel, my own]",failure
16,Dick Cavett,"The very phrase 'Oscar night' used to accelerate my pulse. For one thing - dating myself - it meant Bob Hope. He always had good, strong jokes, that faultless delivery, and always a new joke about his own films' failure - once again - to be honored.","[hope, good, myself]",failure
17,P. J. O'Rourke,"The Communist bloc of old was a study in the failure of failure. Losers in the Soviet economy were the people at the end of the long lines for consumer goods. Worse losers were the people who had spent hours getting to the head of the line, only to be told that the goods were unavailable.","[end, people, study]",failure
18,Hamish Bowles,"This is how I started: My mom was crazy for antique shops and junk shops, and my sister and I would play this game where, if we were driving with my parents and saw a junk shop or an antique shop, we'd scream at the top of our lungs. My poor father would have heart failure and screech to a halt, and we'd leap out and go and explore.","[father, mom, sister]",failure
19,William T. Vollmann,"Everybody is an expert on one thing - that's what I learned in my high school journalism class - and that's, of course, his own life. And everybody deserves to live and have his story told. And if it doesn't seem like an interesting story, then that's the failure of the listener, or the journalist who retells it badly.","[life, school, journalism]",failure
20,David Henry Hwang,"We all deal with failure. If you're lucky to have a long career, it's part of the experience.","[experience, career, lucky]",failure
21,Martha Beck,"Cheerfully fessing up to our failures turns crazy mind off, humility and compassion on. I learned this in a karate dojo that had a strange tradition. Everyone there loved recounting failure stories, and after an evening of smacking one another, we'd sit and have a beer while the students swapped tales of martial arts disaster.","[mind, compassion, beer]",failure
22,Andrew Ross Sorkin,"No one suggested Lehman deserved to be saved. But the argument has been made that the crisis might have been less severe if it had been saved, because Lehman's failure created remarkable uncertainty in the market as investors became confused about the role of the government and whether it was picking winners and losers.","[government, uncertainty]",failure
23,Andrew Ross Sorkin,"In truth, in the fairy-tale version of bailing out Lehman, the next domino, A.I.G., would have fallen even harder. If the politics of bailing out Lehman were bad, the politics of bailing out A.I.G. would have been worse. And the systemic risk that a failure of A.I.G. posed was orders of magnitude greater than Lehman's collapse.","[truth, politics, risk]",failure
24,Andrew Ross Sorkin,The failure of Lehman may have allowed the government to do more to prop up the economy than it otherwise could.,"[government, economy, may]",failure
25,John James Audubon,"I looked long and carefully at the picture of a stag painted by Landseer - the style was good, and the brush was handled with fine effect; but he fails in copying Nature, without which the best work will be a failure.","[best, work, nature]",failure
