0,Lucy Hale,"The acting part of me is not me. The music side is who I really am and what I want to talk about. It'll be hard for people to differentiate those different sides but I think it's possible. Once the music is out there, people will start to realize how serious I am about it rather than, 'Oh god, another actress making an album.'","[god, i am, people]",music
1,Sade Adu,"Once a song's out there, it's no longer mine. And that's the whole purpose of music: to belong to people.","[purpose, people, song]",music
2,Youssou N'Dour,World music is about taking things from different places and bringing them together - which is great.,"[great, together, world]",music
3,Keith Jarrett,"Music always turns into music. As soon as I play a key, push a key down, there's no theory any more. When I go and I hear a sound on the keyboard, all theories go out the window.","[window, down, push]",music
4,Stacy Schiff,"I can't write a line without music - it provides just the right amount of distraction to keep me focused. Clearly, I still miss the noisy roommates.","[me, distraction, roommates]",music
5,Ben Horowitz,"When I was CEO, and I'd listen to music, a lot of people listen to music and you get inspiration from it. And a lot of things in hip hop are very instructive for being in business. Particularly, hip hop is a lot about business, and so it was very useful for me in any job.","[business, job, people]",music
6,Pina Bausch,"When I first began choreographing, I never thought of it as choreography but as expressing feelings. Though every piece is different, they are all trying to get at certain things that are difficult to put into words. In the work, everything belongs to everything else - the music, the set, the movement and whatever is said.","[work, thought, words]",music
7,Yanni,"There is no gender to my music. There's no male or female voice, no trite lyrics or poetry. It's much more abstract, so it lives with you longer.","[poetry, gender, voice]",music
8,Skrillex,"Hip-hop and electronic music are so similar, in the fact that they're both very visceral, have so much bass; a lot of times, it's the same tempos. The culture and some of the sound design is different but a lot of times, it's the same stuff.","[culture, design, hip-hop]",music
9,Nick Cave,"The work ethic at art school is completely different than the work ethic amongst people who get into music. People who paint, it's an honorable thing to spend all day and all night in front of your canvas - that is the romantic vision of the painter.","[work, art, romantic]",music
10,Bruce Dickinson,"With the Internet, bands can come and go every five minutes and the music looks disposable.","[internet, come and go, looks]",music
11,Hunter Hayes,"I'm from Louisiana, and that's where I got my start, in Cajun music. There's a huge music scene down there centered around our culture. Those are people that are not making music for a living. They are making music for the fun of it. And I think that's the best way I could have been introduced to music.","[best, culture, fun]",music
12,Gabby Douglas,Gospel music always relaxes me and calms my nerves.,"[me, always, gospel]",music
13,Pritam Chakraborty,"There was a time that I was only known for being a plagiarist. It used to hurt at times because there was so much effort I was putting into music. And instead of that, it was a couple tunes that I had reproduced from folk songs to remake as film songs, which were being written about.","[time, effort, hurt]",music
14,Chance The Rapper,I think it's so dope that I'm here in Chicago and contributing to the music scene that's thriving. People are so happy Chicago's shining that everyone is willing to say 'I represent Chicago.' That wasn't always the case.,"[happy, people, think]",music
15,Howard Schultz,Starbucks has changed the rules of engagement for the music industry.,"[rules, music industry]",music
16,Yoko Ono,"I always believed that my work should be unfinished in the sense that I encourage people to add their creativity to it, either conceptually or physically. Back in the 1960s, I was calling for 'Unfinished Music,' number one, and number two, with my artwork - I was taking unfinished work into the gallery. And that's how I was looking at it.","[work, creativity, people]",music
17,Gene Simmons,Music is feeling. You can try to verbalize it. It really just hits you or it doesn't.,"[try, feeling, you]",music
18,James Taylor,I have a love-hate relationship with the Grammys because I don't see the music world as a competitive sport.,"[relationship, world, see]",music
19,Damon Albarn,"Music is something that should speak for itself, straight from the heart. It took me a long time to understand that.","[time, heart, me]",music
20,Damon Albarn,"I spent two years figuring out how I could turn it into something that would satisfy me as a musician but also make some kind of cross-cultural link. I feel that I kind of at least touched on the possibilities of cross-cultural music, but it is a lifetime's work, and I don't profess to be anything other than a novice at it.","[work, me, feel]",music
21,James Franco,"There's a tacit belief that actors shouldn't write books, they're sort of allowed to direct movies but there will be a lot of skepticism, and they shouldn't do artwork or music. There are these invisible roadblocks to gain entree to these areas for actors, and you kind of have to crash through those invisible barriers.","[belief, movies, you]",music
22,Jill Scott,Soul music is about longevity and reaching and touching people on a human level - and that's never going to get lost.,"[soul, people, lost]",music
23,Trent Reznor,"It's a humbling thing, having kids. One of my sons came to rehearsals, and now he says Daddy's job is 'go play loud music.'","[job, play, daddy]",music
24,Mikhail Baryshnikov,"I found that dance, music, and literature is how I made sense of the world... it pushed me to think of things bigger than life's daily routines... to think beyond what is immediate or convenient.","[life, daily, dance]",music
25,Iggy Pop,"The most successful stuff is sold to you as indispensable social information. The message in the music is, 'We are terribly, terribly slick and suave, and if you listen to us, you can probably get a leg up in society, too.'","[society, successful]",music
