3,Mira Nair,"I listen to Ustad Vilayat Khan's 'Raga Khamaj' and 'Raga Jaijaiwanti' virtually every morning, a lot of Abdullah Ibrahim, Michael Kiwanuka, Savages, and contemporary Ugandan pop.","[listen, every, savages]",morning
4,Rachel Nichols,I love stretching in the morning. It's the first thing I do when I wake up because getting a good back-crack is so extremely satiating. I feel taller when I finally stand.,"[love, good, wake up]",morning
5,Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,"Each morning sees some task begun, each evening sees it close; Something attempted, something done, has earned a night's repose.","[night, evening, something]",morning
6,Jill Soloway,"On Sunday morning, it's Brooklyn Bagels on Beverly Boulevard. We get them hot. Then we walk some of the famous Silver Lake steps or hike in the hills to the highest vantage point to see the reservoir.","[walk, lake, see]",morning
7,Sarah Parcak,"Scorpions like holes. We had to put our arms in the holes to dig out the smelting residues.

12,Christie Brinkley,"My smile has been my ticket to the world. Smiling releases the same feel-good hormones you get jogging. Caring for your lips and gums is important.

13,Greg Rutherford,"My parents were great at making sure I got out of bed when I needed to play football on a Sunday morning and that I was ready after school to go to training on a Tuesday and Thursday.

15,Stella McCartney,"I am a fashion designer. I'm not an environmentalist. When I get up in the morning, number one I'm a mother and a wife, and number two I design clothes.

17,Dan Jenkins,"I can only tell you that eggs, country ham, biscuits, a pot of coffee, a morning paper, a table by the window overlooking the veranda and putting green, listening to the idle chitchat of competitors, authors, wits and philosophers, hasn't exactly been a torturous way to begin each day at the Masters all these years.","[coffee, day, listening]",morning
18,Beth Ditto,"For me the greatest revenge of all is having a happy adulthood, waking up in my gorgeous turquoise bedroom in the morning beside a person who really inspires me.

21,Rachel Sklar,Emily Gannett is tireless. I know this because I have traded emails with her at 2 A.M. only to later wake blearily to a chipper morning missive sent south of 6 A.M. before her morning run.,"[know, her, later]",morning

23,Walter Kirn,"Cross the wrong state border with your gun, or wake up one morning to new legislation or a new presidential executive order, and suddenly you're the bad guy, not the good guy.

24,Aaron Sorkin,I've got plenty of quirks. I go to an office early in the morning. Early in the morning is really good writing time. I take anywhere between six to eight showers a day. I'm not exaggerating. I'm not a germaphobe: it's all about a fresh start.,"[time, good, day]",morning
25,Aaron Sorkin,"I get the 'The New York Times' and 'Los Angeles Times' thrown at my door every morning. I'll read the front page of 'The New York Times,' then the op-eds, then scan the arts section and then the sports section. Then I do the same with the 'L.A. Times.'","[sports, door, page]",morning
