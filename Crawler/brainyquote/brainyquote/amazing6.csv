0,Amanda Crew,I have mixed feelings about how fast things are changing as a result of technology.

5,Karyn Parsons,"The problem with relegating black history to one really short month, the shortest month, is not only are we telling the same stories over and over again - which are amazing, George Washington Carver is incredible, there's nobody like Frederick Douglass - but there are so many.","[history, black, problem]",amazing
6,Andre Leon Talley,"One my favorite things is to go to the provinces of Russia and see the 18th century wood churches with the onion dome architecture.

24,George Lucas,"One of the amazing things about 'Seven Samurai' is that there are a lot of characters.

She was amazing.","[love, mother, drawing]",amazing
