2,Clark Gregg,"There's something about the superheroes and the idea behind their relationship with humans, whether it's a metaphor for the better part of ourselves, or the more flawed part of ourselves.

3,Bjork,"Living in a capital in Europe but still surrounded by mountains and ocean, my relationship to music was strongest walking to school and back.

10,Penny Pritzker,"I tend to be a person who starts with the presumption that I should trust you until you abuse the privilege, and then our relationship is forever changed.
