0,Samaire Armstrong,"Frankie Muniz is amazing at everything he does. Many people don't know that he can play the piano like you wouldn't believe, and he can bowl and play basketball like you wouldn't believe.","[believe, basketball, people]",amazing
1,Kirk Cameron,"Some of our kids are adopted and some kids are natural-born - I forget which ones are which. Family's just amazing. We think that of everything that we could do in the world... if you don't take care of your family and raise your kids, you lose.","[family, world, care]",amazing

4,Lynda Barry,"I tried to be like the richer kids as much as I could because I wanted to live on their streets, at least hang out on their streets and eat their amazing food and walk barefoot on their shag carpets.

Jews make awkward colonial overlords.","[suffering, people, me]",amazing
9,Peter Capaldi,"I'm not terribly well read. My wife forces books into my hands and insists I read them, which I'm grateful to her for. She made me read 'War and Peace.' The whole thing.

13,Eleanor Catton,"I feel very strongly influenced by long-form box-set TV drama... I feel really excited that, at last, the novel has found its on-screen equivalent, because the emotional arcs and changes that you can follow are just so much more like a novel, and so many amazing shows recently have done as much as film can do to show the interior world.","[world, changes, you]",amazing

19,Jackie Evancho,"It's always exciting to see different cities I love, and go on tour buses. It's so much fun to travel.

22,Jason Mraz,"I have an amazing social-media wing man who manages my Facebook fan site. All my blogs get copied there. My e-mail in-box exploded, and I don't have that kind of time. My mom and sister have their whole life on Facebook, and I'm not there.","[life, time, mom]",amazing
23,J. G. Ballard,The Internet is an amazing development.,"[internet, development]",amazing
24,Rose Leslie,"I have had the most wonderful childhood, and I was raised in a very loving family.
