0,Daniela Bobadilla,"In between shooting for 'Awake,' I was attempting to have my own pilot season.

1,Koren Zailckas,"I think what I learned in research is that as Americans, we're very distrustful of anger. We're not sure if we should repress it. The idea that anger is supposed to be controlled is American, and we try to keep it out of our homes.","[research, american, think]",anger
2,Koren Zailckas,"I think, for one, we have to really accept that anger is a normal human emotion that can be a positive force for change.","[positive, change, accept]",anger

4,Peter Benchley,"We are already perilously close to killing off the top of the oceanic food chain - with catastrophic consequences that we can't begin to imagine. Let us not, in the heat of anger, reduce the already devastated population of great white sharks by one more member.","[food, great, consequences]",anger
5,Adam Hamilton,"I think anger is a normal response to something horrible that someone has done, another human being has done, and to rob people of life, and that's actually healthy to have, to feel that. At some point you have to figure out, 'How do I let that go?'","[life, people, healthy]",anger
6,David Horsey,"As long as anger, paranoia and misinformation drive our political debate, there are unhinged souls among us who will feel justified in turning to violent remedies for imagined threats.","[political, debate, long]",anger
7,Joshua Oppenheimer,"Denial, panic, threats, anger - those are very human responses to feeling guilt.","[guilt, feeling, denial]",anger
8,Joss Whedon,"There's a lot of anger in the Twitter-verse, as I've discovered. But there's a lot of love.","[love, lot, discovered]",anger
9,Henry Rollins,"To anger female voters in America is to tread on the tiger's tail. Women turn out in huge numbers, and they are well aware of how their bodies work and what they need.","[work, women, america]",anger
10,Douglas Coupland,"I think that to acknowledge a new generation is to acknowledge some degree of obsolescence in yourself, and that is very hard to do and often comes with undeniable anger.","[yourself, generation, think]",anger
11,Clint Eastwood,I've had no problem harnessing anger.,"[problem, no problem]",anger
12,Gloria Steinem,"Anger is energising. The opposite of anger is depression, which is anger turned inward.","[depression, opposite, inward]",anger

17,Alanis Morissette,"When I was younger, I was terrified to express anger because it would often kick-start a horrible reaction in the men in my life. So I bit my tongue. I was left to painstakingly deal with the aftermath of my avoidance later in life, in therapy or through the lyrics of my songs.","[life, men, my life]",anger
18,Alanis Morissette,"When someone says that I'm angry it's actually a compliment. I have not always been direct with my anger in my relationships, which is part of why I'd write about it in my songs because I had such fear around expressing anger as a woman.","[fear, woman, angry]",anger
19,Alanis Morissette,"It's a joke to think that anyone is one thing. We're all such complex creatures. But if I'm going to be a poster child for anything, anger's a gorgeous emotion. It gets a bad rap, but it can make great changes happen.","[great, child, changes]",anger
20,Alanis Morissette,"What influenced me was Tori Amos, who was unapologetic about expressing anger through music, and Sinead O'Connor. Those two in particular were really moving for me, and very inspiring, before I wrote 'Jagged Little Pill.'","[music, moving, me]",anger
21,Alanis Morissette,"Anger has been a really big deal for women: how can we express it without feeling that, as the physically weaker sex, we won't get killed. The alpha-woman was burned at the stake and had her head chopped off in days of old.","[women, sex, feeling]",anger
22,Alanis Morissette,"My own approach has always been to push intense emotions down and attempt to deal with them later. When I was younger, I was terrified to express anger because it would often kick-start a horrible reaction in the men in my life.","[life, men, my life]",anger
