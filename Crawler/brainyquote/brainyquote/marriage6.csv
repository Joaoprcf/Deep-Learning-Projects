2,John Updike,Every marriage tends to consist of an aristocrat and a peasant. Of a teacher and a learner.,"[teacher, every, peasant]",marriage
3,Jim Wallis,"The media seems to think only abortion and gay marriage are religious issues. Poverty is a moral issue, it's a faith issue, it's a religious issue.","[faith, poverty, media]",marriage
4,John Updike,"The first breath of adultery is the freest; after it, constraints aping marriage develop.","[adultery, first, breath]",marriage
5,William Penn,"In marriage do thou be wise: prefer the person before money, virtue before beauty, the mind before the body; then thou hast a wife, a friend, a companion, a second self.","[beauty, money, mind]",marriage
6,Ted Olson,"Another argument, vaguer and even less persuasive, is that gay marriage somehow does harm to heterosexual marriage. I have yet to meet anyone who can explain to me what this means. In what way would allowing same-sex partners to marry diminish the marriages of heterosexual couples?","[gay, me, argument]",marriage
7,Charlie Sheen,"I'm 0 for 3 with marriage - the scoreboard doesn't lie, never has. So what we all have is a marriage of the heart. To sully or contaminate or radically disrespect this union with a shameful contract is something that I will leave to the amateurs and the Bible grippers.","[heart, lie, bible]",marriage
8,Keith O'Brien,"Redefining marriage will have huge implications for what is taught in our schools, and for wider society. It will redefine society since the institution of marriage is one of the fundamental building blocks of society. The repercussions of enacting same-sex marriage into law will be immense.","[society, law, building]",marriage
9,Madonna Ciccone,"On the one hand, the idea of marriage and the sort of traditional family life repulses me. But on the other hand, I long for it, you know what I mean? I'm constantly in conflict with things. And it is because of my past and my upbringing and the journey that I've been on.","[life, family, journey]",marriage

13,Malcolm Turnbull,"Let us be honest with each other. The threat to marriage is not the gays. It is a lack of loving commitment - whether it is found in the form of neglect, indifference, cruelty or adultery, to name just a few manifestations of the loveless desert in which too many marriages come to grief.","[commitment, grief, desert]",marriage
14,Gene Robinson,"The state's interest in marriage is stability. Generally speaking, polygamy does not work for stability. Inherent in the whole polygamous movement is a deep and abiding misogyny and denigration of women. So polygamy is objectionable on lots of grounds.","[work, women, deep]",marriage
15,Gail Collins,"Gay rights is just a matter of time. Look at the polls. Worrying about gay marriage, let alone gay civil unions or gay employment rights, is a middle-age issue. Young people just can't see the problem. At worst, gays are going to win this one just by waiting until the opposition dies off.","[time, alone, waiting]",marriage
16,Marina Abramovic,My mother and father had a terrible marriage. They celebrated their wedding anniversary one year with their friends. Why did they celebrate? Maybe because they had lasted so many years without killing each other.,"[father, anniversary, wedding]",marriage
17,Mary Karr,"If dysfunction means that a family doesn't work, then every family ambles into some arena in which that happens, where relationships get strained or even break down entirely. We fail each other or disappoint each other. That goes for parents, siblings, kids, marriage partners - the whole enchilada.","[family, work, parents]",marriage
18,Dada Vaswani,"The Hindu marriage may be described as the union of two families. In this union, there is no room for petty ambitions and personal ego-trips. What is involved is love for the entire family that one is marrying into.","[love, family, may]",marriage
19,Curtis Jackson,"Obama is for same-sex marriage. If the president is saying that, then who am I to go the other way?","[way, who am i, saying]",marriage
20,Gisele Bundchen,"When I'm weak, you can be strong; when I'm strong, you can be weak. That's what I believe marriage is.","[strong, believe, i believe]",marriage

22,"H. Jackson Brown, Jr.",Remember that creating a successful marriage is like farming: you have to start over again every morning.,"[morning, successful]",marriage
23,Gordon B. Hinckley,"Marriage, in its truest sense, is a partnership of equals, with neither exercising dominion over the other, but, rather, with each encouraging and assisting the other in whatever responsibilities and aspirations he or she might have.","[she, partnership, whatever]",marriage
24,Paul Bloom,"The irrationality of disgust suggests it is unreliable as a source of moral insight. There may be good arguments against gay marriage, partial-birth abortions and human cloning, but the fact that some people find such acts to be disgusting should carry no weight.","[good, gay, people]",marriage
25,Brad Paisley,"There may be people in my audience who may not agree with me on some particular issue - you know, say, as a gun owner, they may not agree with me, or, you know, someone may not agree with me on a gay marriage topic. Any of those things. But those shouldn't be the reasons you listen to my music.","[music, gay, people]",marriage
