0,Wim Wenders,Movies are something people see all over the world because there is a certain need for it.,"[world, people, see]",movies
1,Casey Wilson,"Frankly, 'Bride Wars' got made because movies with women need to be about weddings and love.","[love, women, bride]",movies
2,Demetri Martin,"I'd love to win trophies, be in movies, have a body of work I'm proud of and find a way to enjoy it along the way. Success is probably a more of a complicated thing than that.","[love, success, work]",movies
3,Johnny Depp,"I'll take photographs with kids. People who want to take photographs with me. People who like the movies. People who supported me. I'll do that all day, all night, that's fine. But the bombardment of the paparazzi is just... I truly don't understand. It just feels like this kind of gluttonous, horrific sport. It's like sport.","[day, night, people]",movies
4,Jean-Luc Bilodeau,"I like to go out if there's a party or go to the movies, but I just like hanging out with my buddies and having a good time.","[time, good, party]",movies
5,John Wayne,My folks always let me go to the movies every Saturday. We were really motion-picture goers.,"[me, always, go]",movies
6,Sam Huntington,"There are movies that I love tonally, that I would love to emulate. Anything from Wes Anderson or the Coen brothers is right in my wheelhouse, as something that I would aspire to. I love that kind of indie, fun, colorful, funny, sweet, heartfelt but dark film.","[funny, love, fun]",movies
7,Aishwarya Rai Bachchan,"I was studying to be an architect, I wasn't plotting to join the movies. Films were just another career option. I took acting up with the same schoolgirl enthusiasm I had for examinations. Acting is a job and I take it very seriously.","[job, career, studying]",movies
8,Dean Cain,"I get a lot of action scripts. I get low-budget vehicles that will end up right on the video shelf. I want to do movies that I want to talk about, that I'm proud of, but I also want to make a living.","[end, proud, living]",movies
9,Brion James,"I never play a villain that I don't have something I can either do or say so the audience sees there is something redeemable about them. In other words, I don't want to do evil for evil's sake. I don't want to do Jason slasher movies. There's no point in that.","[evil, words, want]",movies
10,Sean Penn,There are a few directors around who I have some excitement about spending my $7 at the theatre watching their movies.,"[theatre, watching]",movies
11,Dennis Farina,"When I was a kid going to the movies, we'd go because Bogart was in the movie, or Cagney, or John Wayne. We didn't know what the story was about or anything.","[know, story, kid]",movies
12,Cameron Diaz,"I haven't deliberately set out to play the blonde bombshell in my movies. In fact, it's probably been quite the opposite. After the success of The Mask, I wasn't offered all that many blonde bombshell parts, to be honest. I think people believed from the beginning that I could actually walk and talk at the same time.","[success, time, beginning]",movies
13,Mindy Kaling,"I have a great job writing for 'The Office,' but, really, all television writers do is dream of one day writing movies. I'll put it this way: At the Oscars the most famous person in the room is, like, Angelina Jolie. At the Emmys the huge exciting celebrity is Bethenny Frankel. You get what I mean.","[great, day, writing]",movies
14,Steve Sabol,"You know how I came up with the name 'Road to the Super Bowl?' It's an homage to the old Bob Hope - Bing Crosby buddy movies - you know, like 'Road to Zanzibar' or 'Road to Morocco.' Can you tell? All I've done my whole life is go to movies.","[life, hope, road]",movies
15,Richard D. Zanuck,"I think we simply all like to project ourselves into somebody else - somebody who is better-looking, richer, smarter. It's comforting. It's escapism, and that, of course, is what the movies are supposed to be all about. Ultimately, I think it's just part of human nature to pretend.","[nature, human nature, think]",movies
16,Salman Khan,"People are patronizing the theatres with renewed enthusiasm - there is an entire picnic-like attitude when families go out to see movies, which is a very good sign. They want to see larger-than-life characters on the big screen and not just watch movies on television or on DVDs.","[attitude, good, people]",movies
17,Christian Marclay,"We go to the movies to forget about time, to be in a dream state. And it's entertainment, distraction, from the fact that everything is kind of crumbling in front of our eyes.","[time, eyes, dream]",movies
18,Emir Kusturica,"The most difficult part of making movies is to keep making them. Maybe, you could make the biggest hit in the world, but then the big problem is what to do next and how to maintain devoted to a certain instinct that I have about films.","[world, problem, difficult]",movies
19,Frank Miller,"I grew up on the crime stuff. Spillane, Chandler, Jim Thompson, and noir movies like Fuller, Orson Welles, Fritz Lang. When I first showed up in New York to write comics back in the late 1970s, I came with a bunch of crime stories but everybody just wanted men in tights.","[men, late, crime]",movies
20,Tony Kushner,"As much as I hate his movies, Oliver Stone has an aspiration I admire, and that is that he wants his art to be part of what makes and changes public policy and cultural practice.","[art, hate, practice]",movies
21,Lucy Hale,"I love 'Paranormal Activity' and 'The Exorcist.' 'The Shining' is a great one too, but there's not a lot that scares me. Maybe it's because I know the other side of it, and I know how movies are made, but it takes a lot for me to get freaked out.","[love, great, me]",movies
22,Donald Glover,"I call 'Community' the best day job in the world, because between takes, I get to write music. I get to write sketches. I get to write movies. It's the best job ever.","[music, best, community]",movies
23,Vincent Cassel,"Cinema is entertainment, and people go to the movies because they want to feel good and forget about everything.","[good, people, feel good]",movies
24,Michael Ian Black,"Best strategy for a first date is to ask her questions. Just keeping asking her questions about herself. Her life, her job, her friends, her taste in movies and music and everything. People mostly just want to talk about themselves, so let her do that.","[life, music, best]",movies
25,Shailene Woodley,"I like to think of myself as a fairly educated human being, but I'm a very uneducated actor when it comes to movies, directors, producers, actors for that matter.","[myself, think, actor]",movies
