0,P. J. O'Rourke,"We loved cars until the '70s or so. Then they became appliances. They turned into motorized cup holders. Most of it has to do with urban sprawl. What began as pleasure ends up in necessity, as so many things do.","[loved, pleasure, urban]",car
1,P. J. O'Rourke,"Cars let us out of the barn and, while they were at it, destroyed the American nuclear family. As anyone who has had an American nuclear family can tell you, this was a relief to all concerned.","[family, american, you]",car
2,P. J. O'Rourke,The car provided Americans with an enviable standard of living. You could not get a steady job with high wages and health and retirement benefits working on the General Livestock Corporation assembly line putting udders on cows.,"[health, job, retirement]",car
3,P. J. O'Rourke,"By the end of the 1950s, American cars were so reliable that their reliability went without saying even in car ads. Thousands of them bear testimony to this today, still running on the roads of Cuba though fueled with nationalized Venezuelan gasoline and maintained with spit and haywire.","[today, end, american]",car
4,Tom Stoppard,"Theater in New York is nearer to the street. In London, you have to go deep into the building, usually, to reach the place where theater happens. On Broadway, only the fire doors separate you from the sidewalk, and you're lucky if the sound of a police car doesn't rip the envelope twice a night.","[deep, fire, police]",car
5,Mario Andretti,The banked oval tracks are obsolete tracks for Indy cars.,"[indy, tracks, oval]",car
6,Tony Stewart,"I'm not going to just stop doing it because I got hurt once. People get hurt in car wrecks every day, and they don't stop driving the car the rest of their life to work. It's my passion. It's what I want to do with my life. It's a part of what I do.","[life, work, passion]",car
7,Tony Stewart,"You get around people who see us away from the track, and it's a pretty big contrast. You're still competitive, and you still want to win everything, but I think in the car, we're focused and passionate all the time. We get outside the car, and we're a lot more relaxed and easygoing, enjoying things away from racing.","[time, people, win]",car
8,Paul Watson,"We need to stop flying, stop driving cars and jetting around on marine recreational vehicles.","[flying, driving, stop]",car
9,David Gerrold,"If you were a kid in 1955, you would pick up a copy of 'Popular Science' and it would say, 'This is the kind of car you're going to be driving in five years or in 20 years you'll be able to take a jet plane from New York to London in four hours,' or something like that. We actually got used to the idea that the future's going to be different.","[future, science, london]",car
10,Austin Mahone,"YI teamed up with the Allstate Foundation to basically inform teens why it's important to drive safe. I feel I'm new on the road, so it's important to do these three main things: The first one is buckle up, the second one is slow down, don't speed, and the third one is don't let your friends distract you in the car.","[road, friends, foundation]",car
11,Norman Foster,I think cars encapsulate the history of innovation and style - it's the other side of the coin of the car being public enemy No.1.,"[history, innovation, style]",car
12,Martin Rees,Manufacturing doesn't just mean building cars and metal-bashing; it includes making pharmaceuticals and hi-tech electronics. A crucial part of the process is the research and development that allows better and greener products to come to market. Britain has traditionally had a strong science and engineering base.,"[science, strong, research]",car
13,Martin Rees,"Perhaps future space probes will be plastered in commercial logos, just as Formula One cars are now. Perhaps Robot Wars in space will be a lucrative spectator sport. If humans venture back to the moon, and even beyond, they may carry commercial insignia rather than national flags.","[future, moon, space]",car

16,Akio Toyoda,"I ride many different cars. Let's say I would drive 200 different vehicles in a year, so it's rather difficult to say which car or what car I ride. I love cars.","[love, year, ride]",car
17,John Kruk,People in West Virginia do have cars. We have indoor plumbing. We even use knives and forks.,"[people, west, virginia]",car
18,Hugh Jackman,"I had a fairly enlightened dad, though if you looked at his resume, it might not seem that way. He was a chartered accountant for Price Waterhouse. He was strict, and we had a very ordered life. To this day, I am the least materialistic person I know, because my father didn't raise me to just go out and buy this or that car.","[life, father, dad]",car
19,Kate Fleetwood,"When you're in a rehearsal room, it's like getting into a car and going on a long journey with everyone's stuff in the back. If you keep stopping the car and going, 'Are you sure we want to go?' and think, 'This is really daunting,' you will get frightened, so you just have to keep ploughing through it.","[journey, want, think]",car
20,Casey Wilson,"My dad always said that 90 percent of marital problems could be solved by getting your blood sugar up, and he's right! So I would say pick a partner who's forgiving when you have low blood sugar and threaten to drive your car through your shared home.","[home, dad, problems]",car

25,Criss Angel,"I have mentally overcome situations most of you would be terrified to ever attempt: heights, fire, needles, spiders, snakes, angry monkeys, being shot, being hit by a car, going blind - you name it, I have been in a situation where I have had to mentally overcome my inherent fears to do my job.","[fire, job, angry]",car
