0,Maksim Chmerkovskiy,"I am a hopeless romantic who falls in lust and gets in trouble. I love my work and am very productive, yet I always find time to play.","[love, work, time]",romantic
1,Benjamin Bratt,"Building a little bonfire at night on the beach and lying on a blanket with my wife under the stars is not only sexy, it's romantic.","[stars, beach, wife]",romantic
2,William Dunbar,"Scotsmen are metaphisical and emotional, they are sceptical and mystical, they are romantic and ironic, they are cruel and tender, and full of mirth and despair.","[emotional, cruel, despair]",romantic
3,Paul Lynde,The whole romantic part of my life was a wipeout. I didn't even own a belt.,"[life, my life, belt]",romantic
4,Jamie Oliver,"I'm better with my hands, and I always loved the slightly romantic idea of starting with bits of wood and being able to create something to sit on, to eat from, to store your clothes in.","[hands, wood, loved]",romantic
5,Eric Bana,I'm a bit of a romantic.,[bit],romantic
6,Wes Anderson,Any romantic feelings for a 12-year-old are like entering into a fantasy world.,"[world, feelings, fantasy]",romantic
7,Nancy Meyers,"There's a hardening of the culture. Reality TV has lowered the standards of entertainment. You're left wondering about the legitimacy of relationships. It's probably harder to entertain the same people with a more classic form of writing, and romantic comedies are a classic genre.","[culture, writing, people]",romantic
8,Nancy Meyers,"Movies don't look hard, but figuring it out, getting the shape of it, getting everybody's character right and having it be funny, make sense and be romantic, it's creating a puzzle. Yes, having been a writer for so long, I have an awareness of when things are going awry, but it doesn't mean I know how to fix them.","[funny, character, puzzle]",romantic
9,Padma Lakshmi,"I know most people use their phones to tell time, but there's something very romantic and beautiful about a timepiece.","[time, beautiful, people]",romantic
10,Stephenie Meyer,"No, actually 'The Host' was totally a palate-cleanser for me. I wanted to do something a little bit different than romantic love. Romantic love is in there, obviously, because I enjoy writing about that and living it a lot.","[love, love is, writing]",romantic
11,Gary Oldman,"I don't think Hollywood knows what to do with me. I would imagine that when it comes to romantic comedies, my name would be pretty low down on the list.","[me, name, down]",romantic
12,Harlan Coben,"The state of New Jersey is really two places - terrible cities and wonderful suburbs. I live in the suburbs, the final battleground of the American dream, where people get married and have kids and try to scratch out a happy life for themselves. It's very romantic in that way, but a bit naive. I like to play with that in my work.","[life, work, happy]",romantic
13,Frank Black,"It more or less has the shape of a love song, but 'Crescent Moon' reflects more my longing for an ancient romantic context that includes wild animals, fire, danger of death, stellar navigation, and seasonal intuition.","[love, death, moon]",romantic
14,Jessica Brown Findlay,I am a hopeless romantic.,"[i am, hopeless]",romantic
15,Ellen Page,"Mind you, Roman Holiday - which is kind of a romantic comedy - is one of my favorite films, and I think Audrey Hepburn is absolutely phenomenal in that movie.","[holiday, mind, think]",romantic
16,Andrew Bird,My mom had this romantic notion of her children playing classical music. The idea is you learn it when you're still learning language. It's using the same part of the brain.,"[music, learning, mom]",romantic
17,Charles Saatchi,"I hate to sound like a romantic adolescent, but I believe artists don't generally see art as a career choice; they simply can't overcome their desire to make art, and will live on little income for as long as they have to, before they start to sell their work - or give up and get a paying job.","[work, art, hate]",romantic
18,Rachel Hurd-Wood,"I love comedy, but it has to be hysterical and really amusing; I'm not really a big fan of romantic comedies, in fact I can't stand them. I'm really more of a fan of 'Team America' and 'Dodgeball.'","[love, team, america]",romantic

20,Janeane Garofalo,"German accents and Hassidic accents aren't that romantic. They're more harsh. Although Hebrew, when spoken by certain people, sounds beautiful. There's this beautiful woman I know who speaks Hebrew, and when she speaks, it's so attractive. Maybe it's who's speaking it.","[beautiful woman, beautiful]",romantic
21,Joni Mitchell,"I loved Debussy, Stravinsky, Chopin, Tchaikovsky, anything with romantic melodies, especially the nocturnes. Nietzsche was a hero, especially with 'Thus Spoke Zarathustra.' He gets a bad rap; he's very misunderstood. He's a maker of individuals, and he was a teacher of teachers.","[teacher, hero, loved]",romantic
22,Gillian Jacobs,"A friend of mine wrote a script, a feminist romantic comedy. She had a feminist scholar consult on it. My friend said, 'Oh, my friend Gillian read it and really loved it.' She goes, 'Gillian Jacobs, you mean: Britta Perry, feminist icon?'","[loved, she, friend]",romantic
23,Spencer Boldman,"I like doing something romantic with a girl on Valentine's Day, like making her dinner and keeping it simple. The more quality time, the better.","[time, day, simple]",romantic
24,"Robert M. Parker, Jr.","Wine writers have been around for almost as long as there has been wine, but in the past, generally speaking, most wine writing was uncritical and emphasized wine as a romantic, historic beverage. Criticism and comparative tastings were eschewed for fear of offending the trade, which most writers depended upon for survival.","[fear, past, wine]",romantic
25,Pearl Cleage,I really love writing comedy. Writing romantic comedy is even nicer because you get to write about how insane we all act when we're falling in love.,"[love, writing]",romantic
