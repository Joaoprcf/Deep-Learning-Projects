0,Paul Davies,Is there anything science should not try to explain? Science is knowledge and knowledge is power - power to do good or evil. Sometimes ignorance is bliss.,"[knowledge, good, power]",science
1,Richard Carmona,"The average person doesn't understand what a stem cell is. There's a lack of health literacy in our nation. So the public can't really get into this dialogue because they don't understand the complexity of stem cells, not the faith-based approach, not the ideological or political, but the science behind stem cells.","[health, political, nation]",science
2,Sam Harris,"Science does not limit itself merely to what is currently verifiable. But it is interested in questions that are potentially verifiable (or, rather, falsifiable).","[questions, limit, rather]",science
3,Nancy Pearcey,Schools ought to teach students to challenge secular ideologies masquerading as science in the classroom.,"[challenge, teach, students]",science
4,Neil deGrasse Tyson,"All the traditional STEM fields, the science, technology, engineering, and math fields, are stoked when you dream big in an agency such as NASA.","[technology, engineering]",science
5,Neil deGrasse Tyson,Science is basically an inoculation against charlatans.,"[against, basically]",science
6,Neil deGrasse Tyson,I can't tell you how many people say they were turned off from science because of a science teacher that completely sucked out all the inspiration and enthusiasm they had for the course.,"[teacher, people, enthusiasm]",science
7,Eli Broad,"The happiest people I've found are in science. These people have three times the IQ - maybe I'm exaggerating. They have a higher IQ than I do. They love what they're doing, they have a good family life, they're satisfied.","[life, love, family]",science
8,Mustafa Kemal Ataturk,"My people are going to learn the principles of democracy, the dictates of truth and the teachings of science. Superstition must go.","[truth, democracy, people]",science
9,Bill Nye,"Science is the best idea humans have ever had. The more people who embrace that idea, the better.","[best, people, better]",science
10,Afrika Bambaataa,"I'd like to see people pay attention to the science of hip hop. The knowledge part, the political side of what hip hop could do, or where hip hop is gonna go. I always say it's gonna become universal as we become a galactic union.","[knowledge, political, people]",science
11,J. Michael Straczynski,"In every other science fiction series, humans are at the top of the food chain. In the 'Babylon 5' universe, they're in the bottom third.","[food, universe, fiction]",science
12,Morgan Fairchild,"When the AIDS epidemic broke, because I happened to be a science nerd and knew a lot about viruses and a lot about that virus at the time, I felt a moral obligation to go out and try to stem the fear and get out and explain to people what the disease was and how it worked.","[time, fear, people]",science
13,Buzz Aldrin,"Globalisation means many other countries are asserting themselves and trying to take over leadership. Please don't ask Americans to let others assume the leadership of human exploration. We can do wonderful science on the Moon, and wonderful commercial things. Then we can pack up and move on to Mars.","[leadership, moon, trying]",science
14,William Gibson,"I didn't have a manifesto. I had some discontent. It seemed to me that midcentury mainstream American science fiction had often been triumphalist and militaristic, a sort of folk propaganda for American exceptionalism.","[american, me, fiction]",science
15,Ray Kurzweil,"All different forms of human expression, art, science, are going to become expanded, by expanding our intelligence.","[art, intelligence, human]",science
16,Neil deGrasse Tyson,"I like to believe that science is becoming mainstream. It should have never been something that sort of geeky people do and no one else thinks about. Whether or not, it will always be what geeky people do. It should, as a minimum, be what everybody thinks about because science is all around us.","[believe, people, something]",science
17,Neil deGrasse Tyson,"Part of what it is to be scientifically-literate, it's not simply, 'Do you know what DNA is? Or what the Big Bang is?' That's an aspect of science literacy. The biggest part of it is do you know how to think about information that's presented in front of you.","[information, know, think]",science
18,Marcel Duchamp,"All painting, beginning with Impressionism, is antiscientific, even Seurat. I was interested in introducing the precise and exact aspect of science, which hadn't often been done, or at least hadn't been talked about very much.","[beginning, painting, done]",science
19,Nathan Fielder,"I loved theatre and did magic, too, but I was never the best at it - there was never a teacher saying, 'You're great, you have to make this your career!' I was good at science and math. I figured I'd go into science and become a dentist.","[best, teacher, good]",science
20,Paolo Bacigalupi,"When we talk about dystopias, especially in young adult fiction, a lot of them are essentially science fictional futures. They aren't necessarily tied to the traditional concept of dystopia. And so in that space, my impression is that kids love reading about weird, wild, adventurous places, and dystopia fits that bill.","[love, reading, space]",science
21,Sonya Hartnett,"If I'm desperate, I'll read anything. But even when I can be choosy, I still have no hard-and-fast rules. I have rules about what I won't read, rather than what I will. No science fiction, no romance, no chick lit. Although even these rules can be broken.","[rules, broken, fiction]",science

23,Karl Popper,Science may be described as the art of systematic over-simplification.,"[art, may, systematic]",science
24,Matthew McConaughey,I love having my hands in the dirt. It is never a science and always an art. There are no rules. And if it comes down to me versus that weed I'm trying to pull out of the ground that doesn't want to come out? I know I'll win.,"[love, art, hands]",science
25,Sally Ride,"For whatever reason, I didn't succumb to the stereotype that science wasn't for girls. I got encouragement from my parents. I never ran into a teacher or a counselor who told me that science was for boys. A lot of my friends did.","[teacher, parents, friends]",science
