0,Conan O'Brien,Keep cool my babies.,"[babies, keep]",cool
1,Kaya Scodelario,"It was really cool to work with Dakota Fanning. I've watched her grow up and I've always loved her films, loved her. It was amazing working with someone who was American as well, because obviously it's going to be a different energy straightaway. We got on really well; she's so professional and hardworking.","[work, amazing, american]",cool
2,Daniel Radcliffe,"I've never been one of the cool people at school, but then again, I don't get the people who are cool. It's not that I don't like them, it's just that they don't interest me.","[school, people, me]",cool
3,Zayn Malik,"If you meet a girl, you meet a girl. It's normal, so if you exchange numbers, whatevs, it's cool.","[girl, you, meet]",cool
4,Thomas Frank,"Maybe that first, gigantic deficit the Reaganites piled up was an accident, just a combination of deluded 'supply side' tax cuts and a huge bag of good stuff for the Pentagon. But pretty quickly conservatives discovered that deficits, when done correctly, did something really cool: deficits defunded the Left.","[good, tax, something]",cool
5,Shay Mitchell,"I'm a fan of designers and clothes that look beautiful, but more importantly, make me feel beautiful and confident. It's why I've always loved Stella McCartney, and more recently, Prabal Gurung. Their pieces are cool, yet timeless, and the fits are effortlessly flattering.","[beautiful, me, loved]",cool
6,Jenna Fischer,Sometimes acting is really cool because it forces you to exercise certain muscles in your personality that you wouldn't normally be called upon in life.,"[life, personality, exercise]",cool
7,Josh Radnor,"Cynicism is kind of like folding your arms and stepping back and commenting on things, like the old guys in 'The Muppets,' just throwing out comments all the time, whereas there are other people on the ground really trying to affect things and improve their lives and the lives of other people. I think it's noble and I think it's cool.","[time, people, trying]",cool
8,Spider Robinson,"Now that I finally have the time for it, this web surfing stuff turns out to be as interesting and fun and addictive as you've all been telling me. Zipping from link to link, chasing an idea across the noosphere, sucking up information like a killer whale - way cool.","[time, fun, me]",cool
9,Sasha Pieterse,"Being in L.A., it was really hard to find a country writer and producer. I eventually - years of searching - found this guy, Dan Franklin. He's an incredible musician and producer. We write so well together... It's been a really cool experience.","[experience, together, find]",cool
10,Alison Brie,"I think Twitter is such a cool thing because it really is a direct line to the fans and for fans back to you, and it's such a new thing. I think in the past there's been usually fan mail and that's really good, but Twitter, it gets an immediate response.","[good, past, think]",cool
11,Michael B. Jordan,"L.A. is cool. If I could have the rest of my family out there, I think it would make it that much better for me. As far as work and the weather, you can't really beat it. I just wish they had the New York social life out there. That would make it perfect.","[life, family, work]",cool
12,Mark Ronson,"Being a die-hard Knicks fan, I remember hunting down these orange-and-blue Nikes that they only released in England. And I used to hunt for sneakers when I DJ'd in Japan. But then Nike flooded the market with a head-spinning array of color combinations and it just didn't seem cool anymore.","[color, hunting, remember]",cool
13,Issa Rae,"Black and awkward is the worst, because black people are stereotyped as being anything but awkward in mainstream media... Black people are always portrayed to be cool or overly dramatic, anything but awkward.","[media, black, people]",cool
14,Vanilla Ice,"To me, a critic is some loser who has no idea... someone with an opinion. We all have opinions. No offense, but what makes them dictate what is cool and what is not.","[me, opinions, loser]",cool
15,Luke Bryan,"I would like to be a heart surgeon or brain surgeon... something with that knowledge and the ability to save a life would be pretty cool. I wasn't that good in science class, though.","[life, knowledge, science]",cool
16,Kelli Berglund,"I love Demi Lovato's style. It's really different, but it's super chic and has a cool edge to it. I'm always trying to channel her style when going shopping for new clothes or getting dressed in the morning.","[love, morning, style]",cool
17,Bailey Chase,"'Damages' was cool. It brought me back to New York for a little while, so that was a lot of fun, and I was obviously very excited about the opportunity to work with Rose Byrne and Glenn Close. I'd been a fan of that show before I started working on it.","[work, opportunity, rose]",cool
18,Laura Ramsey,"Statistically, Portland, Oregon has the most street kids, like kids that run away from home and live on the street. It's like a whole culture thing there. If you walk around on the streets, there are kids living on the streets, begging for money, but it's almost like a cool thing. They all just sit around and play music and squat.","[music, home, money]",cool
19,Alber Elbaz,"If you take something out of the freezer, it's cold, but what happens when it melts? It's a cool party, a cool person, a cool collection. What does that mean? I'm more interested in things that are uncool, things that have a certain individuality, a certain soul, a certain longevity, emotion, fragility.","[soul, party, individuality]",cool
20,Kathleen Hanna,Feminism rotates between backlash and interest. And the cool thing about the Internet is that it's allowing women more access to their own history. Part of the problem before the Internet was that we didn't know which books to read. Someone had to tell you.,"[history, women, internet]",cool
21,James Frecheville,I wear a lot of things for fun. Sometimes I'll wear one item that is deliberately stupid because that will make the outfit cool.,"[fun, stupid, sometimes]",cool
22,Linus Torvalds,No-one has ever called me a cool dude. I'm somewhere between geek and normal.,"[me, normal, somewhere]",cool
23,Idina Menzel,"The cool thing is that, unlike film, the theatre roles for women get better and better as you get older.","[women, theatre, better]",cool
24,Ruth Ozeki,Maybe all teenagers feel like they don't fit in. I never felt like a cool kid. I remember being bullied for being Asian.,"[remember, feel, kid]",cool
25,Landon Donovan,"I got to say 'Hi' to Dolly Parton, which my mom thought was kind of cool.","[mom, thought, kind]",cool
