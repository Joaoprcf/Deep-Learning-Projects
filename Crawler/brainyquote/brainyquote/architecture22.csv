1,Robert Palmer,"Trying to describe something musical is like dancing to architecture, it's really difficult.","[trying, difficult, something]",architecture
2,Amanda Hearst,"Zaha Hadid's Maxxi Museum is proof that Rome and contemporary architecture are no longer a paradox. The building is characteristic Hadid - with curving lines and organic shapes - and the permanent collection already boasts works by Francesco Clemente, William Kentridge, and Gerhard Richter.","[building, rome, paradox]",architecture
3,Stefan Sagmeister,"Downtown Toronto is a very good place to talk about the neutrality of modernist architecture. I'm sure this kind of box-building was interesting in the Twenties, Thirties and Forties, but I think it's absolutely ridiculous to build like this in 2013.","[good, think, place]",architecture
4,Charles Eames,In architecture the idea degenerated. Design allows a more direct and pleasurable route.,"[design, more, idea]",architecture
5,Malcolm Wallop,Doctrines provide an architecture for both Republican and Democrat presidents to carry out policies.,"[republican, carry]",architecture

7,Janet Echelman,"As a child, I always enjoyed building forts by stringing up bed sheets and clothes. I continue to be inspired by makeshift structures, including my own kids' forts and temporary architecture of all sorts.","[child, building, clothes]",architecture
8,Janet Echelman,"I never studied sculpture, engineering or architecture. In fact, after college I applied to seven art schools and was rejected by all seven.","[art, college, engineering]",architecture
9,Alex Ebert,"In a place like the Greek Theater in L.A., to try and create a close connection with the audience seems almost antithetical to the architecture of the building.","[building, try, connection]",architecture
10,Ian Hamilton Finlay,"The same sort of thing happened in my dispute with the National Trust book: Follies: A National Trust Guide, which implied that the only pleasure you can get from Folly architecture is by calling the architect mad, and by laughing at the architecture.","[trust, book, you]",architecture
11,Leon Krier,"Modernist architecture and town planning is inimical to human beings... based on the Darwinian concept that evolution is open ended, that there must always be something new and better.","[planning, evolution, better]",architecture
12,Leon Krier,"If a dictator takes up my ideas, the resulting town will survive the political system that commissioned it and stand as a social good. Besides, modernism rather than classicism has dominated the architecture of totalitarian regimes of both the left and right.","[good, political, stand]",architecture
13,Leon Krier,"You need a prince to make a town in an intellectual sense. Developers want to make money. If they cared about architecture, they'd become architects. I've had so many projects that never came off because they had no sponsor, and not because they were utopian. I just want to build a town that's normal.","[money, intellectual, want]",architecture
14,Leon Krier,I don't build because I am an architect. I can make true architecture because I do not build.,"[i am, true, build]",architecture

17,Bjarke Ingels,Architecture is restricted to such a limited vocabulary. A building is either a high-rise or a perimeter block or a town house.,"[building, vocabulary, house]",architecture
18,Paul Bettany,"But I feel truly wowed by the architecture and the meaning of the architecture if you get lost in it and think about the man hours in the smallest little chapel, and the love involved. God it's fantastic.","[love, god, man]",architecture
19,Tony Hale,"What's fascinating about D.C., the exteriors are these elaborate structures, this gorgeous architecture and beautiful stonework, and then you go inside and it's crap-looking - apart from the White House, which is beautiful.","[beautiful, you, inside]",architecture
20,Frances Mayes,"I think I went to Italy initially for the art, architecture, food and history, but I stayed there because of the people in Cortona.","[art, food, history]",architecture
21,Nate Lowman,"Architecture is a discourse; everything is a discourse. Fashion discourse is actually a micro-discourse, because it's centered around the body. It is the most rapidly developing form of discourse.","[fashion, body, everything]",architecture
22,Dexter Fletcher,"I love walking along Leith's waterfront and wandering around some of New Town's beautiful streets and squares, with their gorgeous Georgian architecture.","[love, beautiful, walking]",architecture

24,Edith Pearlman,"Architecture is undistinguished, sometimes derelict, but occasionally, as in 'Post and Beam,' there is something arresting in a setting... the building behind the Cathedral.","[building, sometimes]",architecture
25,Robin Lord Taylor,"I initially thought I would be an architect, maybe. So I went to architecture camp and quickly learned that I did not want to be an architect. I was like, 'No. This is not for me.'","[thought, me, want]",architecture
