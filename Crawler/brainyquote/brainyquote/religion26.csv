5,Jake Roberts,"I'm not really into religion, OK. I saw a lot of things I did not like when I got into organized religion.

And it's not anybody's damn business how we talk.","[relationship, business, god]",religion

21,Tina Turner,"I never close a door on any other religion. Most of the time, some part of it makes sense to me. I don't believe everyone has to chant just because I chant. I believe all religion is about touching something inside of yourself.","[time, believe, yourself]",religion
