0,Nikolai Gogol,There are certain words which are nearer and dearer to a man than any others.,"[man, words, others]",communication
1,Lewis Thomas,"I won't compare ants and people, but ants give us a useful model of how single members of a community can become so organized that they end up resembling, in effect, one big collective brain. Our own exploding population and communication technology are leading us that way.","[technology, community, end]",communication
2,William Ellery Channing,"The mind, in proportion as it is cut off from free communication with nature, with revelation, with God, with itself, loses its life, just as the body droops when debarred from the air and the cheering light from heaven.","[life, nature, light]",communication

4,Henry Miller,"The great work must inevitably be obscure, except to the very few, to those who like the author himself are initiated into the mysteries.

5,Deborah Tannen,"Communication is a continual balancing act, juggling the conflicting needs for intimacy and independence. To survive in the world, we have to act in concert with others, but to survive as ourselves, rather than simply as cogs in a wheel, we have to act alone.","[alone, independence, world]",communication
6,Morrissey,"That's why I do this music business thing, it's communication with people without having the extreme inconvenience of actually phoning anybody up.","[music, business, people]",communication
7,Thomas Gold,"I wrote somewhere during the Cold War that I sometimes wish the Iron Curtain were much taller than it is, so that you could see whether the development of science with no communication was parallel on the two sides. In this case it certainly wasn't.","[war, science, wish]",communication
8,Alton Brown,I like television. I still believe that television is the most powerful form of communication on Earth - I just hate what is being done with it.,"[hate, believe, earth]",communication

10,Mary Martin,There is a world of communication which is not dependent on words.,"[world, words, dependent]",communication
11,Matthew Lesko,"A degree of lying - you know, white lies - seems to be inherent in all languages and all forms of communication.","[know, you, white]",communication
12,James Merrill,Strange about parents. We have such easy access to them and such daunting problems of communication.,"[parents, problems, easy]",communication
13,Erykah Badu,"What does music mean to me? I don't think I would really be much without it, without it coming through me. It's my means of communication, my means of growth, my means of transportation from one point in my life to another.","[life, music, growth]",communication
14,Judd Nelson,"I love the rehearsal process in the theatre, and the visceral sense of contact and communication with a live audience.","[love, theatre, live]",communication
15,Thom Mayne,"But I absolutely believe that architecture is a social activity that has to do with some sort of communication or places of interaction, and that to change the environment is to change behaviour.","[change, architecture]",communication
16,Evelyn Glennie,"Music is about communication... it isn't just something that maybe physically sounds good or orally sounds interesting; it's something far, far deeper than that.","[music, good, interesting]",communication
17,John Paul DeJoria,Being able to communicate with a loved one that you haven't talked to in a while because of some communication break makes their life and your life in a much better place.,"[life, loved, better]",communication

19,Lyall Watson,"The limits of sensory evolution in fish are defined very largely by their habitat. Water is physically supportive, carries some kinds of odour well, and is kind to sound - letting it travel several times faster than air will allow, but it inhibits other more personal kinds of communication.","[travel, water, fish]",communication
20,Justin Rosenstein,"If you look at the history of communication, new technologies like the phone and e-mail didn't just let people do things faster; it fundamentally changed the scope of the kinds of projects people dared to take on.","[history, people, look]",communication
21,Doug Jones,"I learned mime back when I was in college, at Ball State University, Indiana. That woke up my body from the neck down and made me realize that acting and communication - portraying a story, event, or emotion - is a full-body experience.","[experience, college, me]",communication
22,Margaret Atwood,"Communications technology changes possibilities for communication, but that doesn't mean it changes the inherited structure of the brain. So you may think that you're addicted to online reading, but as soon as it isn't available anymore, your brain will pretty immediately adjust to other forms of reading. It's a habit like all habits.","[technology, brain, reading]",communication
23,Emraan Hashmi,"My hectic work schedule does not often permit me time to visit temples, but my conversations with God don't depend on idol worship. Inside my heart, I have developed and sustained a direct communication with Him.","[work, time, god]",communication
24,Lyle Lovett,"Dad often told me, 'My job is to help my boss do his job and make him look good.' That was my dad's objective. Everything about the way he conducted himself was to communicate support for his superiors and respect for his coworkers. The way he dressed was his starting point in that communication.","[respect, good, dad]",communication
25,Deborah Eisenberg,"Politics is a matter of human transaction. I consider absolutely everything political, because all fiction involves relationships between people, and relationships between people always include matters of power, of equity, of communication.","[power, politics, political]",communication
