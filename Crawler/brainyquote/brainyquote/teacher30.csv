0,Sue Townsend,"In the playground, I always made people laugh; I used to charge them three pence for an impression of a teacher. It kept me in toffees.","[people, me, laugh]",teacher
1,Mark Zandi,"In the fourth grade, my history teacher gave us a project: Why was the auto industry located in Detroit, Michigan? I didn't know I was going to be an economist, but I knew I was going to do something that was involved in answering questions like that one because I thought that was a fascinating question.","[history, thought, questions]",teacher
2,Dave Davies,"We need balance. We need to balance our inner life with our outer life. Nature is always sitting there waiting to help us, but we have to do the work. Nature is probably the greatest teacher that we'll ever have... the earth and nature.","[life, work, nature]",teacher
3,Jessica Valenti,"I think day care is terrific. Kids get to be around other kids, and they're playing, and they're teaching each other. When I was in college, my summer job was being a preschool teacher. I loved it, and after that experience, I said I can't wait to put my kid in day care because I could see how much they loved it.","[experience, college, day]",teacher
4,Juan Felipe Herrera,"If I can only be known as one thing, then, well, I guess it would be poet and performer and teacher.","[i can, then, guess]",teacher

6,Abraham Verghese,"There are moments as a teacher when I'm conscious that I'm trotting out the same exact phrase my professor used with me years ago. It's an eerie feeling, as if my old mentor is not just in the room, but in my shoes, using me as his mouthpiece.","[shoes, me, moments]",teacher
7,Ian McShane,"I had a teacher at school who said, 'We are going to do a play next year, and you're in it.' He said, 'You should try out for the Royal Academy as an actor.' I did and got in. I was 17. My mum wasn't too happy, but it worked out OK.","[happy, school, year]",teacher
8,Lou Doillon,"The whole point of art school is that you're going to be able to have nudes all day long and a teacher who is there to move you. It's great. I did a tiny bit in the one school in Paris, and it was wonderful because you'd have a nude taking a crazy position, and you'd have 10 seconds to do a drawing. Then you'd do a one-minute drawing.","[art, great, school]",teacher

11,Simon Hoggart,"During my own gap year, I learned an invaluable lesson - that I was a lousy teacher. Even though the children I 'taught,' in upcountry Uganda, were desperate for qualifications, they largely ignored me. Until, that is, I realised that they wanted to hear about other young persons around the world.","[children, world, year]",teacher
12,Richard LaGravenese,"Connie Heermann is a Freedom Writer teacher. I believe she represents the best of what dedicated teachers can be because she chose to serve her students, not her school board.","[best, freedom, school]",teacher
13,Clay Aiken,"Well, financially it's a little bit better. But it's better than than when I was a teacher. But I kind of - it's allowed me to buy a house. And I've been able to help my mother with some stuff and my brother. So, that's nice.","[mother, brother, help]",teacher
14,Brittany Howard,"We had a music teacher in sixth grade, and I saw her tune her guitar. I said, 'Whoa. There's a certain way to do this.' I bought a packet of strings - some of mine were broken - and had her tune it for me. For a while, I just kept it like that. But I got the Internet finally, when I was 14, and started learning.","[music, learning, internet]",teacher
15,Leslie Fiedler,"Faulkner turned out to be a great teacher. When a student asked a question ineptly, he answered the question with what the student had really wanted to know.","[great, student, know]",teacher
16,Piet Mondrian,"Experience was my only teacher; I knew little of the modern art movement. When I first saw the works of the Impressionists, van Gogh, van Dongen, and Fauves, I admired it. But I had to seek the true way alone.","[art, experience, alone]",teacher
17,Burgess Owens,Experience can be a great teacher.,"[experience, great]",teacher
18,Mike Barnicle,"Unlike other professions - doctor, lawyer, teacher, journalist, sales clerk, stock broker - when a cop makes a bad mistake, it could mean someone is dead. They take home mental baggage unlike anything carried in almost every other job.","[home, job, sales]",teacher

21,Tim Gunn,"If you told me when I was a teen that I would end up being a teacher, I would have said you're out of your mind, because quite frankly I hated school.","[end, school, mind]",teacher
22,Felicity Kendal,"My father was my trainer, my teacher. He was closer to my sister in the sense that she adored him and he adored her. He was more like my pal. Because of the 13-year gap, I think by the time I came along, it wasn't a big deal. I wasn't spoilt or cherished, I was just put to work.","[work, time, father]",teacher
23,William Glasser,"We can teach a lot of things, but if the teacher can't relate by talking to a group of friendly students, he'll never be a competent teacher.","[group, teach, talking]",teacher
24,William Glasser,What students lack in school is an intellectual relationship or conversation with the teacher.,"[relationship, school]",teacher
25,William Glasser,"This is at the heart of all good education, where the teacher asks students to think and engages them in encouraging dialogues, constantly checking for understanding and growth.","[education, good, growth]",teacher
