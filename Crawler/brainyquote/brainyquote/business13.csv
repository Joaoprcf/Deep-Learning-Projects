2,James Chanos,"The Macau casinos have a wonderful business, it's taking in money from Chinese businessmen elsewhere who send it through junky companies to casinos to gamble. The growth continues and they have basically western managers and western accounting, so we trust the numbers a little bit more.","[money, trust, growth]",business
3,Georgia Jagger,"I want to be an entrepreneur too; I like the business side of things. When I was younger I wanted to be a vet or a tightrope walker. But I have no sense of balance and I can't bear animals dying, so I abandoned both ideas.","[balance, ideas, animals]",business

9,Betty White,I am interested in a lot of things - not just show business and my passion for animals. I try to keep current in what's going on in the world. I do mental exercises.

11,Matt Taibbi,"What we have now is a situation where politicians get a whole bunch of money from mainly business interests.

12,Miroslav Volf,"For Christian faith not to be idle in the world, the work of doctors and garbage collectors, business executives and artists, stay-at-home moms or dads and scientists needs to be inserted into God's story with the world. That story needs to provide the most basic rules by which the game in all these spheres is played.","[work, god, faith]",business

16,Hayley Atwell,"Documenting trips makes them that much richer. I stick in train tickets and business cards from restaurants.

17,Andre Balazs,"I don't think it ever does any harm in any business to feel that there is someone there who cares about it. If you look at any business, fashion being the most obvious, the aura, or the reality of the designer, is part of what creates it. It's true in luxury goods stores and in good food stores. It leaves a palpable sense that someone cares.","[food, good, good food]",business

21,Nathan Myhrvold,"Anybody who can afford a box of business cards can afford a Web site. Any company with an 800 number can move its services to the Web for peanuts by comparison.

23,Marjane Satrapi,"The movie business is not about the money. Of course, you need money to make the movie. If you have a small budget, adapt yourself.
