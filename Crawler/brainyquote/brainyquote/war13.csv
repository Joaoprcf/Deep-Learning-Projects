1,Barack Obama,"We've persevered because of a belief we share with the Iraqi people - a belief that out of the ashes of war, a new beginning could be born in this cradle of civilization. Through this remarkable chapter in the history of the United States and Iraq, we have met our responsibility. Now, it's time to turn the page.","[time, history]",war
2,Warren Buffett,"We've used up a lot of bullets. And we talk about stimulus. But the truth is, we're running a federal deficit that's 9 percent of GDP. That is stimulative as all get out. It's more stimulative than any policy we've followed since World War II.","[truth, world, world war ii]",war
3,Imelda Staunton,"Looking back, there is nothing wrong with that peace, love and equality that the hippies espoused.

4,James P. Hoffa,"We didn't start this war - the right wing did. We're tired of seeing good-paying jobs shipped overseas. This fight is about the economy, it's about jobs and it's about rebuilding America.","[america, fight, tired]",war
5,James P. Hoffa,"This union has been divided in like a civil war - brother against brother - sister against sister. And I'm pulling it together.

We have to be united in one cause.","[together, sister, brother]",war

10,Aung San Suu Kyi,"My attitude to peace is rather based on the Burmese definition of peace - it really means removing all the negative factors that destroy peace in this world. So peace does not mean just putting an end to violence or to war, but to all other factors that threaten peace, such as discrimination, such as inequality, poverty.","[peace, attitude, end]",war

14,Christopher Hitchens,"I love it when Muslims go to war with each other, as I do when the Christians do, because it shows there's no such thing as the Christian world and the Islamic world. That's all crap.","[love, world, christian]",war

16,Asghar Farhadi,"Classical tragedy was the war between good and evil. We wanted evil to be defeated and good to be victorious. But the battle in modern tragedy is between good and good. And no matter which side wins, we'll still be heartbroken.","[good, evil, battle]",war
17,Daniel Ellsberg,"My feelings of revulsion and foreboding about nuclear weapons had not changed an iota since 1945, and they have never left me. Since I was 14, the overriding objective of my life has been to prevent the occurrence of nuclear war.","[life, me, my life]",war

20,Frank Miller,"Where I would fault President Bush the most was that, in the wake of 9/11, he motivated our military, but he didn't call the nation into a state of war. And he didn't explain that this would take though a communal effort against common foe.","[effort, fault, military]",war
21,Garrett Hedlund,"See, the 'On the Road' that came out in 1957 was censored. A lot of the honesty of it, the bitter honesty, is in the original scroll version that came out in 2007 on the 50-year anniversary. Back then, there was so much post-Second World War fear that was imposed on everybody - 'You must live life this way' - and these guys were bored.","[life, anniversary, fear]",war
