2,Brandon Boyd,"Female artists are the perfect example of a creator: They know how to make life and art with their bodies. Life comes from their bodies, so on a very basic level, they have more to write about.","[life, perfect, know]",art
3,Camille Paglia,"It's high time for the art world to admit that the avant-garde is dead. It was killed by my hero, Andy Warhol, who incorporated into his art all the gaudy commercial imagery of capitalism (like Campbell's soup cans) that most artists had stubbornly scorned.","[time, hero, world]",art
4,Keith Haring,"The public needs art - and it is the responsibility of a 'self-proclaimed artist' to realize that the public needs art, and not to make bourgeois art for a few and ignore the masses.","[responsibility, artist]",art
5,Frank Ocean,"In art, at a certain level, there is no 'better than.' It's just about trying to operate for yourself on the most supreme level, artistically, that you can and hoping that people get it.","[yourself, people, trying]",art

7,Jerry Saltz,"It took the Metropolitan Museum of Art nearly 50 years to wake up to Pablo Picasso.

9,Jerry Saltz,"Art is for anyone. It just isn't for everyone. Still, over the past decade, its audience has hugely grown, and that's irked those outside the art world, who get irritated at things like incomprehensibility or money.","[money, past, world]",art

13,Nick Cave,"The work ethic at art school is completely different than the work ethic amongst people who get into music. People who paint, it's an honorable thing to spend all day and all night in front of your canvas - that is the romantic vision of the painter.","[music, work, romantic]",art
14,Lana Del Rey,"I don't believe in the school of hard knocks, although I've had them. All that stuff about whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger is so not true. Do you know what makes you stronger? When people treat you and your art with dignity.","[school, believe, people]",art
15,Tom DeLonge,"I don't listen to punk any more, unless it's right before I play. Not that I don't like it, it's nostalgic. But, it's for kids and it should be... it's not art, it's expression.","[listen, punk, play]",art
16,Sonu Nigam,"For me, learning is a continuous process and an all-inclusive one - reading a book, learning a musical instrument or learning the martial art called taekwondo. Teach myself something new - that's my prayer.","[learning, myself, prayer]",art

22,Cy Twombly,"I look at a lot of artists. I'm inspired by - I suppose I shouldn't say 'inspired,' but it's not really influenced. I am inspired. Art comes from art.","[i am, look, say]",art
23,John Wayne,"Real art is basic emotion. If a scene is handled with simplicity - and I don't mean simple - it'll be good, and the public will know it.","[good, simple, simplicity]",art
24,Aidan Gillen,There's no way the writing staff of 'Game of Thrones' haven't read 'The Art of War.' There's definitely an influence on 'Game of Thrones' from this book in both a general way and on the character of Lord Baelish and his strategies.,"[war, character, book]",art
