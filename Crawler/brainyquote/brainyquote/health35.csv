9,Richard Carmona,Do any of us actually want to live in a world where your boss can decide that he or she is morally opposed to mental health care?

23,Wendy Davis,We believe in honoring our mothers and fathers and keeping our smallest residents - our children - healthy. The politicians in charge of Texas now clearly don't.
