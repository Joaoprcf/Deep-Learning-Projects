1,Soulja Boy,"When I was in Japan on tour in 2010, I felt like I was 30 years into the future. I love technology and they are so advanced with their phones, computers, everything.

2,Wolfgang Petersen,"Theaters are always going to be around, and doing fine. With computers and technology, we're becoming more and more secluded from each other. And the movie theater is one of the last places where we can still gather and experience something together. I don't think the desire for that magic will ever go away.","[technology, experience]",computers
3,Masi Oka,"I've been programming computers since elementary school, where they taught us, and I stuck with computer science through high school and college.","[science, college, school]",computers
4,Nathan Myhrvold,"The whole hardware industry has experienced the phenomenon in which every time computers get cheaper, they appeal to a new set of users; every time they get more powerful, old customers upgrade.","[time, powerful, new]",computers

Computers are going to keep getting smaller and smaller. Ultimately, they will go inside our bodies and brains and make us healthier, make us smarter.","[change, time, nature]",computers
8,Tyler Cowen,"In chess, computers show that what we call 'strategy' is reducible to tactics, ultimately. It only looks creative to us. They are still just glorified cash registers. This should make us feel uncomfortable, whether or not we think computers will ever be good composers of music or artistic painters.","[music, good, strategy]",computers
9,Buzz Aldrin,"Computers allow us to squeeze the most out of everything, whether it's Google looking up things, so I guess that tends to make us a little lazy about reading books and doing things the hard way to understand how those things work.","[work, reading, looking]",computers

12,Brian Kernighan,"Computers and computing are all around us. Some computing is highly visible, like your laptop. But this is only part of a computing iceberg. A lot more lies hidden below the surface. We don't see and usually don't think about the computers inside appliances, cars, airplanes, cameras, smartphones, GPS navigators and games.","[think, see, inside]",computers

14,Daniel J. Boorstin,"A wonderful thing about a book, in contrast to a computer screen, is that you can take it to bed with you.","[book, you, contrast]",computers

18,Dee Brown,"I've tried word processors, but I think I'm too old a dog to use one.","[dog, think, tried]",computers
19,Bill McCollum,"We demand privacy, yet we glorify those that break into computers.","[privacy, break, demand]",computers
20,Philip Emeagwali,"Because I believe that humans are computers, I conjectured that computers, like people, can have left- and right-handed versions.","[believe, people, i believe]",computers
21,Adlai Stevenson,"To me, there is something superbly symbolic in the fact that an astronaut, sent up as assistant to a series of computers, found that he worked more accurately and more intelligently than they. Inside the capsule, man is still in charge.","[man, me, space]",computers
22,Thomas Nagel,"Eventually, I believe, current attempts to understand the mind by analogy with man-made computers that can perform superbly some of the same external tasks as conscious beings will be recognized as a gigantic waste of time.","[time, mind, believe]",computers
23,William Shatner,"Sci-fi films are the epic films of the day because we can no longer put 10,000 extras in the scene - but we can draw thousands of aliens with computers.","[day, epic, scene]",computers
24,Perry Farrell,"I'm looking to evolve the concept of the new renaissance artist, taking the world by storm through the art of public display and demonstration, with technical savvy, using cell phones and computers.","[art, storm, world]",computers
25,David Mamet,"I understand that computers, which I once believed to be but a hermaphrodite typewriter-cum-filing cabinet, offer the cyber literate increased ability to communicate. I do not think this is altogether a bad thing, however it may appear on the surface.","[think, bad, may]",computers
