0,Alison Sweeney,"We talk a lot on 'Biggest Loser' about how fitness is a natural antidepressant, how it burns off stress. What I like about running is that it gives me time alone.

8,Jon Tester,Montanans believe in the right to make a good life for their families. How they define a family should be their business and their business alone.

10,Arthur L. Herman,Millions of Americans cannot tell you who lived at Mount Vernon or who wrote the Declaration of Independence - let alone the Emancipation Proclamation.

19,Taylor Swift,"I am alone a lot, which is good. I need that time to just be alone after a long day, just decompress.
