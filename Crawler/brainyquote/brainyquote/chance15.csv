5,J. C. Ryle,"What could an unsanctified man do in Heaven, if by any chance he got there? Let that question be fairly looked in the face and fairly answered.

8,V. S. Naipaul,"What I felt was, if you spend your life just writing fiction, you are going to falsify your material.

13,Riz Ahmed,"Trajectories aren't linear. Life's just a roller coaster. If you're getting a chance to do cool stuff, and it's varied stuff, just enjoy it. I guess I'm a believer in the randomness of life rather than it being a linear trajectory or an arc, a consistent smooth arc, towards anything.","[life, cool, enjoy]",chance
