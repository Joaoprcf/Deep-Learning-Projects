0,Michio Kaku,Leaders in China and India realize that science and technology lead to success and wealth. But many countries in the West graduate students into the unemployment line by teaching skills that were necessary to live in 1950.,"[success, technology, wealth]",science
1,Richard Dawkins,"Science has taught us, against all intuition, that apparently solid things like crystals and rocks are really almost entirely composed of empty space. And the familiar illustration is the nucleus of an atom is a fly in the middle of a sports stadium, and the next atom is in the next sports stadium.","[sports, fly, space]",science
2,Michael Nielsen,"If networked science is to reach its potential, scientists will have to embrace and reward the open sharing of all forms of scientific knowledge, not just traditional journal publication. Networked science must be open science.","[knowledge, potential]",science
3,Mitchel Resnick,"I never took a computer science course in college, because then it was a thing you just learned on your own.","[college, computer science]",science
4,Martin Rees,"Given the scale of issues like global warming and epidemic disease, we shouldn't underestimate the importance of a can-do attitude to science rather than a can't-afford-it attitude.","[attitude, global warming]",science
5,Octavia E. Butler,"Science fiction, extrasensory perception, and black people are judged by the worst elements they produce.","[black, people, perception]",science
6,Matt Mullenweg,"In my brief sojourn in college, my favorite classes were political science because I loved the idea of systems we can set up that benefit society - rules we can put in place that sometimes you run against, sometimes they're painful, but ultimately they benefit the world.","[college, society, political]",science
7,Jules Verne,When science has sent forth her fiat - it is only to hear and obey.,"[obey, hear, her]",science
8,Ridley Scott,"In science fiction, we're always searching for new frontiers. We're drawn to the unknown.","[unknown, fiction, new]",science
9,Ha-Joon Chang,"Contrary to what professional economists will typically tell you, economics is not a science. All economic theories have underlying political and ethical assumptions, which make it impossible to prove them right or wrong in the way we can with theories in physics or chemistry.","[political, economics]",science
10,Mary Roach,"Science is you! It's your head, it's your dog, it's your iPhone - it's the world. How do you see that as boring? If it's boring, it's because you're learning it from a textbook.","[learning, dog, world]",science
11,Hideo Kojima,"Genetic engineering is a result of science advancement, so I don't think that in itself is bad. If used wisely, genetics can be beneficial, but they can be abused, too.","[engineering, think, bad]",science
12,Kurt Vonnegut,I had no talent for science. What was infinitely worse: all my fraternity brothers were engineers.,"[talent, engineers]",science
13,N. R. Narayana Murthy,Science is about unravelling nature.,"[nature, about]",science
14,Ramez Naam,"We must learn to set our emotions aside and embrace what science tells us. GMOs and nuclear power are two of the most effective and most important green technologies we have. If - after looking at the data - you aren't in favour of using them responsibly, you aren't an environmentalist.","[power, looking, learn]",science
15,Venkatraman Ramakrishnan,"Science is curiosity, testing and experimenting.","[curiosity, testing]",science

17,Gail Carriger,"I consider science fiction and fantasy my genre. And I've noticed over the years that there doesn't tend to be a lot of lighthearted, comedic stuff.","[fiction, fantasy]",science
18,Saint-John Perse,"Astronomers have been bewildered by the theory of an expanding universe, but there is no less expansion in the moral infinite of the universe of man. As far as the frontiers of science are pushed back, over the extended arc of these frontiers one will hear the poet's hounds on the chase.","[man, universe, moral]",science
19,Simon Kuznets,"Mass application of technological innovations, which constitutes much of the distinctive substance of modern economic growth, is closely connected with the further progress of science, in its turn the basis for additional advance in technology.","[technology, growth, progress]",science
20,Dan Shechtman,"Science is the ultimate tool to reveal the laws of nature, and the one word written on its banner is Truth.","[nature, truth, one word]",science
21,Nicholas Kristof,"What use could the humanities be in a digital age? University students focusing on the humanities may end up, at least in their parents' nightmares, as dog-walkers for those majoring in computer science. But, for me, the humanities are not only relevant but also give us a toolbox to think seriously about ourselves and the world.","[age, end, parents]",science
22,Mario J. Molina,"When I was in elementary school, I was very interested in science already. I must have been ten or eleven years old. I started experiments with chemistry sets at my home in Mexico. I was able to borrow a bathroom and convert it to a laboratory. My parents supported it. They were pleased. My friends just tolerated it.","[home, school, parents]",science
23,Gertrude B. Elion,I had no specific bent toward science until my grandfather died of cancer. I decided nobody should suffer that much.,"[grandfather, nobody, suffer]",science
24,Herbert A. Simon,"By a combination of formal training and self study, the latter continuing systematically well into the 1940s, I was able to gain a broad base of knowledge in economics and political science, together with reasonable skills in advanced mathematics, symbolic logic, and mathematical statistics.","[knowledge, together]",science
25,Helen Sharman,"You don't go into space just for the science. Economically, it is not worth it. I think the reason we should be in space is for the exploration; it's the human endeavour.","[space, think, reason]",science
