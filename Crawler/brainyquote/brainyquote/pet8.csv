0,Karl Pilkington,"To me, a cat is an easy pet, they don't need any spoiling or looking after.","[looking, me, easy]",pet
1,Cara Delevingne,"I need to be able to be at a gig and just put my bag on the floor and not worry about it being stood on or getting ruined. You want a bag that can go through anything. And a little bit of softness is always lovely. If I don't have a dog, I can just pet my bag!","[dog, want, worry]",pet
2,Jeffrey Kluger,"No one ever pretended that shopping for anything is a rational experience. If it were, would there be Fluffernutter? Laceless sneakers? Porkpie hats? Would the Chia Pet even exist?","[experience, shopping, hats]",pet
3,Scott Adams,There's kind of a toll you have to pay with a cat; if you don't pet her for 10 minutes she'll bother you for six hours.,"[she, you, kind]",pet
4,Sloane Crosley,"A pet store is a celebration of dogs' existence and an explosion of options. About cats, a pet store seems to say, 'Here, we couldn't think of anything else.' Cats are the Hanukkah of the animal world in this way. They are feted quietly and happily by a minority, but there's only so much hoopla applicable to them.","[cats, world, animal]",pet
5,Michelle Phan,"Just like hair frames our face, brows frame our eyes. I see so much potential in harmonized beauty whenever I see a woman who's not filling in her brows, and I just want to go in with my brow pencil and just be like, 'Filling in eyebrows, OK, done - look in the mirror and be inspired.' That's one of my pet peeves, but beauty is subjective.","[beauty, eyes, mirror]",pet
6,Mary Roach,"I don't read good books anymore, it seems; I just buy them and put them on the shelf and every now and then walk over and pet them. I'm like the optimistic dieter who fills her closet with clothes two sizes too small and dreams of the day she can wear them. I know just what I want to do when I retire.","[dreams, good, day]",pet
7,Chrissy Teigen,"My big pet peeve with people posting food - and I love it when people post food - but my number one thing is when you're posting at a restaurant, and it's dark, like a date night, food never looks good. Flash looks horrible, no flash looks horrible. It's important to only do food photos during daylight - and it's all about color with Instagram.","[love, food, good]",pet
8,Jimi Hendrix,I got a pet monkey called Charlie Chan.,"[monkey, got, charlie]",pet
9,Sophie Ellis-Bextor,I try not to wear anything I have to fidget with - there's nothing worse than wearing something and pulling down the hem and re-adjusting the top. My pet hate is when girls wear those strapless dresses and spend the whole night yanking them up.,"[hate, night, nothing]",pet
10,Erin O'Connor,"Growing up, I had an insane crush on Neil Tennant of the Pet Shop Boys.","[growing up, growing, crush]",pet
11,David Beckham,"Some men over-tweeze their eyebrows, and it's just too perfect. Men are meant to have kind of a bushy brow. Too much aftershave is also off-putting; it's one of my pet hates.","[men, perfect, kind]",pet
12,Rob Sheffield,"In their heyday, the Pet Shop Boys were the Interpol of the Eighties, dressing up to sing really weird pop songs about lust and loneliness in the big city. They're low-pro now, not retro-worshipped in the manner of Depeche Mode, New Order, or The Cure, but you can hear the reason why - these guys are too sad.","[sad, loneliness, city]",pet
13,Rita Rudner,"We've begun to long for the pitter-patter of little feet - so we bought a dog. Well, it's cheaper, and you get more feet.","[dog, feet, long]",pet
14,James Gleick,"We have a habit of turning to scientists when we want factual answers and artists when we want entertainment, but where are the facts about the nature of the self? Neurologists peering at PET scans and fMRIs know they aren't seeing the soul in there.","[nature, soul, self]",pet
15,Brendon Urie,"My favorite type of pet has always been a dog. They're loyal, kind, and offer endless affection. My friend Eric says, 'The more people I meet, the more I like my dog.' Funny thought.","[funny, dog, people]",pet
16,Jeanette Winterson,"I live alone, with cats, books, pictures, fresh vegetables to cook, the garden, the hens to feed.","[alone, cats, live]",pet
17,James Thurber,"The dog has got more fun out of Man than Man has got out of the dog, for the clearly demonstrable reason that Man is the more laughable of the two animals.","[dog, man, fun]",pet
18,Michael Morpurgo,"Animals are sentient, intelligent, perceptive, funny and entertaining. We owe them a duty of care as we do to children.","[funny, children, animals]",pet
19,Darin Strauss,All writers have their own pet commandments.,"[own, commandments, writers]",pet
20,Alfred North Whitehead,"If a dog jumps into your lap, it is because he is fond of you; but if a cat does the same thing, it is because your lap is warmer.","[dog, you, same]",pet
21,Sam Taylor-Wood,I hate rats. I had a pet rat to try and overcome it. I even gave him mouth-to mouth resuscitation when he had a heart attack. But I couldn't conquer it.,"[heart, hate, conquer]",pet
22,Al Yankovic,"One of my pet peeves is that sometimes the talents of my band get overlooked because, and it was the same problem that Frank Zappa had, with a lot of groups that use humor, people don't realize there's a lot of craft behind the comedy.","[humor, people, problem]",pet
23,Jean Cocteau,"I love cats because I enjoy my home; and little by little, they become its visible soul.","[love, home, soul]",pet
24,David Harsanyi,"In summation, like your beloved pet rock, Twitter is useful only in your imagination.","[imagination, rock, twitter]",pet
25,Art Alexakis,I have a pet peeve about bands that don't play their hits. I think it's kind of selfish.,"[selfish, think, kind]",pet
