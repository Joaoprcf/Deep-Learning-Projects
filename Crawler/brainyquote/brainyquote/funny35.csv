0,Amy Schumer,"I think you can go from being not very funny to working really hard for 10 years and figuring out how to make a living on the road, but I don't think you can rise much above that.","[road, living, rise]",funny
1,Amy Schumer,"To be really great, you need to be naturally funny in order to stand out. But you can work at it, and find the best vehicle that you have to communicate what you're saying to people.","[best, work, great]",funny

3,Marlon Wayans,"Comedy clubs can be brutal. Those people are for real, and if you aren't funny, they aren't laughing. They don't care who you are.","[people, care, you]",funny
4,Chris O'Dowd,"When I was a kid, I wanted to be serious, like Daniel Day-Lewis. No one really dreams of being a comic actor, do they?

You know instantly - either you're funny and getting the laughs, or you're not.","[dreams, discipline, stupid]",funny
5,Emma Roberts,"It's funny, having the same name as someone. Me, Emma Watson and Emma Stone, the amount of times I've been called Emma Watson or Emma Stone is so funny. It's just 'cause we're all named Emma. None of us look alike.","[me, stone, someone]",funny
6,Jennifer Coolidge,"Girls are supposed to be feminine and demure. Comedy isn't about that, so you just have to unlearn it. Certain women are so pretty, they can't go weird enough to be funny. You have to be willing to be ugly. I'm lucky my face can look so hideous.","[women, face, weird]",funny
7,Michael Sheen,"For a culture that has such a problem with death, we seem to deal with it in a quite bizarre way. We see people shot, killed and blown up, and we find it funny and sexy and all those things. But, the reality of it is that every day people die, and people are really sad and they grieve and they go through a really difficult process with it.","[death, sad, culture]",funny
8,Seth Meyers,"Once you get past funny, my other qualities are so below average. It's not like I'm handy.","[past, you, average]",funny
9,Doris Kearns Goodwin,"Those who knew Lincoln described him as an extraordinarily funny man. Humor was an essential aspect of his temperament. He laughed, he explained, so he did not weep.","[humor, man, him]",funny
10,Greg Behrendt,"Part of being a comedian is that it's your job to look at life and regurgitate it in a funny way, to point out its absurdities.","[life, job, look]",funny
11,J. R. Moehringer,"While I was busy hating Vegas, and hiding from Vegas, a funny thing happened. I grew to love Vegas.","[love, busy, vegas]",funny
12,Catherine Tate,"When I realised I had a facility for humour, I latched on to it, and it gave me confidence and I built my personality around it. So I subconsciously made myself become the funny one so that would be my label rather than the ginger one or the red-faced one.","[confidence, myself]",funny
13,Alexa Chung,"It's funny because I think that both France and Britain are known for their distinctive styles, and everyone says that France is so chic and elegant but I think, more than that, French women are renowned for dressing in what suits them.","[women, suits, think]",funny
14,Zadie Smith,"Novels are not about expressing yourself, they're about something beautiful, funny, clever and organic. Self-expression? Go and ring a bell in a yard if you want to express yourself.","[beautiful, yourself, want]",funny
15,Raven-Symone,"I find it funny that people now come up to me and say, 'Wow, you are absolutely gorgeous. I'm like, 'I was beautiful before I lost weight. Egotistically speaking, I thought I was amazing.'","[beautiful, amazing, people]",funny
16,Kim Swift,The drawings in 'Portal' were actually me scribbling that stuff... I had a funny moment when I realized that someone gotten 'The cake is a lie' tattooed on themselves.

17,Issa Rae,"I hate to say it but I hate black humor. I feel like a Klan member saying it, but it's just not funny.","[humor, hate, black]",funny
18,Bill Bryson,"In a funny way, nothing makes you feel more like a native of your own country than to live where nearly everyone is not.","[live, nothing, way]",funny
19,Brian Wilson,"I meditate and I also think about meditation. Which is funny. I think about Maharishi, about just the idea of meditating. It gives me something.","[me, meditation, think]",funny
20,Dana Carvey,"I used to sneak up to the 8th floor and watch Eddie Murphy and Joe Piscopo rehearsing 'Saturday Night Live' and could only wonder if I would ever have the chance to be funny. It took me five years to go up the two stories, but it is such a sense of fulfillment to be able to show what I can do on national television.","[night, me, chance]",funny
21,Ben Schwartz,"It's funny: I put money into short films, and I put really good actors in it, and I write some stuff that's really funny, and I'll get, like, a million views. But to the right of me, there will be a video of a kitten that falls into a toilet bowl, and it's three seconds long, and it will get 25 million views.","[money, good, me]",funny
22,Dawn Olivieri,"It's funny, one of my most solid carpet moments happened in the very beginning, before I started thinking that I needed all these other people to do my hair and makeup, and pick out my clothes.

23,Nick Cave,"People often can't separate, or can't understand, that to be funny is to be serious; it's a way of pulling people in and not scaring them off. I think a lot of the funny stuff, underneath it, there's a deep anxiety going on.","[deep, people, anxiety]",funny
24,Melissa Etheridge,"There's been so many different types of musicals, and it's a funny genre because there's a fine line between clever and stupid. It really takes a genius to know how to do it.","[stupid, know, clever]",funny
25,Melissa Etheridge,"Video is a funny thing. It's one thing to be an artist, singer-songwriter, and use words and create pictures in people's minds. And then be asked to do video for it, to actually give a certain visual for your song.","[people, words, artist]",funny
