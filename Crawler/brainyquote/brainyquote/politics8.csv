0,Robert Novak,Howard Dean is not the first politician to distort facts in his own interests. But many activists in the party he now leads are puzzled over what he thinks he is accomplishing politically. Is it good politics to contend that Iraq was better off under Saddam Hussein than even a flawed Islamic republic?,"[good, party, facts]",politics
1,Barack Obama,"There is probably a perverse pride in my administration... that we were going to do the right thing, even if short-term it was unpopular. And I think anybody who's occupied this office has to remember that success is determined by an intersection in policy and politics and that you can't be neglecting of marketing and P.R. and public opinion.","[success, pride, marketing]",politics

5,William J. Clinton,"When times are tough and people are frustrated and angry and hurting and uncertain, the politics of constant conflict may be good, but what is good politics does not necessarily work in the real world. What works in the real world is cooperation.","[work, good, conflict]",politics
6,Nick Clegg,"One thing I have frankly decided is that when it comes to political reform we have two conservative parties in British politics. Both the Labour and Conservative parties have constantly and repeatedly failed to honour promises they have made about reforming, cleaning, modernising our clapped-out system.","[political, promises]",politics
7,Mark Hoppus,"If we tried to write about politics, you'd realize that we're all a bunch of idiots.","[you, realize, idiots]",politics
8,Tom Peters,"Community organizing is all about building grassroots support. It's about identifying the people around you with whom you can create a common, passionate cause.

9,Nate Silver,"First of all, I think it's odd that people who cover politics wouldn't have any political views.","[political, people, think]",politics
10,Dennis Kucinich,"My philosophy comes from a worldview that looks at the world as one. It's a holistic view that sees the world as interconnected and interdependent and integrated in so many different ways, which informs my politics.","[philosophy, world, view]",politics
11,Vinny Guadagnino,"My political science degree is always on the back-burner. I took my LSAT, so even if I want to take the LSAT again, I know what I'm getting into. I'll keep it on the back-burner. Who knows, maybe with my popularity, I can have a career in politics with a law degree. I think it'll work out either way.","[work, science, law]",politics
12,T. D. Jakes,"I like to see myself as a bridge builder, that is me building bridges between people, between races, between cultures, between politics, trying to find common ground.","[myself, bridge, people]",politics
13,Mark Helprin,"The arts community is generally dominated by liberals because if you are concerned mainly with painting or sculpture, you don't have time to study how the world works. And if you have no understanding of economics, strategy, history and politics, then naturally you would be a liberal.","[time, history, community]",politics
14,Matt Taibbi,"In modern American politics, being the right kind of ignorant and entertainingly crazy is like having a big right hand in boxing; you've always got a puncher's chance.","[crazy, american, chance]",politics
15,Miroslav Volf,There is no more effective way to radicalize American Muslim youth than for political leaders to make public displays of prejudice against all Muslims. Suspicion will undermine their sense of identification with America and alienate some from both the culture and from politics.,"[culture, youth, america]",politics
16,Belle Boyd,"There are those who maintain that in this world women have no right to interfere in the affairs of state, in politics, in plots and counter-plots. Others that are who, more chivalrous, are willing to admit that women have as much right to act, think, and speak as men.","[women, men, world]",politics
17,Carrie Mae Weems,"I got my first camera when I was 21 - my boyfriend gave it to me for my birthday - but at that point politics was my life, and I viewed the camera as a tool for expressing my political beliefs rather than as an art medium.","[life, birthday, art]",politics
18,John Henrik Clarke,"We have been educated into believing someone else's concept of the deity, and someone else's standard of beauty.

22,Beau Willimon,"Like any young person who gets into a political campaign, I joined out of a highfalutin' desire to change the world. But you start to see the sort of tactics people use. You start to see politics not only in the macro but in the micro of the campaign itself. Some people get turned off by this side of it. Other people are drawn to it.","[change, change the world]",politics
23,Tony Benn,"I've got four lovely children, ten lovely grandchildren, and I left parliament to devote more time to politics, and I think that what is really going on in Britain is a growing sense of alienation. People don't feel anyone listens to them.","[time, children]",politics
24,Aung San Suu Kyi,"This was the way I was brought up to think of politics, that politics was to do with ethics, it was to do with responsibility, it was to do with service, so I think I was conditioned to think like that, and I'm too old to change now.","[change, service]",politics
25,Harvey Fierstein,"When a politician like Marco Rubio is willing to sacrifice his career defining immigration reform legislation solely to insure that gays and lesbians are denied equal protection under the law, we have to admit that we're under attack. This is not pragmatic politics at work. These are the policies of bias, exclusion and unfairness.","[work, sacrifice, law]",politics
