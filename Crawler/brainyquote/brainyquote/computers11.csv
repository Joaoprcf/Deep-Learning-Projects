5,Seth Shostak,"Our computers double in capability on time scales of only a few years. It's hardly outrageous to believe that we will successfully develop thinking machines within a handful of decades, or at most a century or two. If that happens, these artificial sentients will quickly leave us behind.","[time, believe, thinking]",computers
6,Peter Diamandis,"With faster Internet and better computers, you'd better believe we're creating and consuming more digital data.","[believe, internet, better]",computers
7,Peter Diamandis,"The U.S. government doesn't build your computers, nor do you fly aboard a U.S. government owned and operated airline.

9,Mark Zuckerberg,"I just think people have a lot of fiction. But, you know, I mean, the real story of Facebook is just that we've worked so hard for all this time.

13,Craig Venter,"'Bloomberg's, you know, for people who don't use the service, provides through the Internet - through specialized computers - information about the financial world.

22,Barton Gellman,"Dell fills its computers with crapware, collecting fees from McAfee and other vendors to pre-install 'trial' versions.","[versions, fees, other]",computers
23,Barton Gellman,"Given the volume of PC sales and the way McAfee runs its operation, I imagine there must be thousands of phantom subscribers - folks who signed up once upon a time and left the software behind two or three computers ago.","[time, sales, way]",computers
