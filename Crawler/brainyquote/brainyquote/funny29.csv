0,Stephen Moyer,A film that I love is 'Raising Arizona' and that's funny but it's quite indie and weird and odd and quirky. I'd love to do something like that. Who knows?,"[love, love is, weird]",funny
1,Chris Pine,I do like dating cynics - they tend to be incredibly funny.,"[dating, like, tend]",funny
2,Jonathan Rhys Meyers,"That's a funny thing, fame. People definitely do treat you differently. When you begin to be successful, people say, 'Don't go changing.' Well, that's easy to say, but the fact is, you don't change at all - other people do.","[change, people, successful]",funny
3,Daniel Dennett,"We adore babies because they're so cute. And, of course, we are amused by jokes because they are funny. This is all backwards. It is. And Darwin shows us why.","[cute, why, jokes]",funny

5,Lorrie Moore,I've never been to a dinner party where everyone at the dinner table didn't say something funny.,"[dinner, party, dinner table]",funny
6,Nathan Myhrvold,"Most visions of extraterrestrial life are actually steeped in human hubris. The fictional extraterrestrials of 'Star Trek' or a hundred other space operas are less alien than many of my neighbors. And funny, the ones running the place are mostly WASPish men.","[life, men, space]",funny
7,Issa Rae,"I used to love being the class clown. I loved to make jokes and make people laugh. There was a set of students who would find it funny. But the cool students were like, 'Eeew!'","[love, cool, people]",funny
8,Pauly Shore,I giggle when I put myself down. It's just funny to me.,"[myself, me, down]",funny
9,Joss Whedon,"I always enjoy conversation more if there is some substance to it - which is a just incredibly hilarious thing for me to say because for many, many years I was the guy whose only contribution to any conversation was, 'There was a funny 'Simpson's' joke about that.'","[me, conversation, enjoy]",funny
10,Alain de Botton,"I was foreign and Jewish, with a funny name, and was very small and hated sport, a real problem at an English prep school.

11,Seth MacFarlane,"If a song is funny and absurd, and it sounds great, it's just going to be that much funnier. And there's no better example of that than 'Monty Python.'","[great, better, song]",funny
12,Larry the Cable Guy,"I just developed my act way back in the late '80s. I went to college in Georgia, so I picked up the Southern accent.

So that was pretty much it.","[time, college, fun]",funny

15,Charlie Korsmo,"Making movies was a real weird kind of adult experience. In a way it was like MIT, in that it was a great education. The big lesson is, people are people. They're smart, funny, creative people, but they're people.","[education, experience, great]",funny
16,Kailash Kher,"I don't follow anything blindly. I have to know the entire thing, if I have to get in to it. It might sound funny to you, but it's like using English language. I use an English word only when I know its meaning and understand its connotation. You won't hear me say, 'What's up, dude' or anything like that just for the heck of it.","[language, me, meaning]",funny
17,Daniel Radcliffe,"Ironing boards are a classic example of something I find horrible about modern society: the excitementation, for want of a better word, of mundane things. Funny ironing board covers - I hate them.","[society, hate, find]",funny

20,Matt Groening,"I think when 'The Simpsons' first came on, there was an uproar. People got used to it. They realized the show's really funny, it's got a heart, so I think it's pretty safe.","[heart, people, think]",funny
21,Janeane Garofalo,"I don't really have funny things to say about politics. I wish I did, but I don't.","[politics, wish, say]",funny
