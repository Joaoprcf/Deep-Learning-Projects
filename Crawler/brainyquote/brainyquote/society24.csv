1,K. D. Lang,"When women make their image about youth and sexuality, and not about intellect, that's kind of a dead-end road. So I think it's a combination of self-entrapment and entrapment by society.","[women, road, youth]",society
2,David Petraeus,"Reconciliation is what takes place, of course, at higher levels. President Karzai has been very clear about the red lines for reconciliation, accept the constitution, lay down their weapons, cut their ties with al Qaeda and essentially become productive or at least participating members of society in that regard.","[constitution, red, accept]",society
3,Marianne Williamson,"We need to shift from an economic organizing principle for human civilization, to a humanitarian organizing principle.

4,Lauryn Hill,"When I was working, and when I was making substantial amounts of money, I always filed and paid my taxes. This only stopped, when it was necessary to withdraw from society, in order to guarantee the safety and well-being of myself and my family.","[family, money, myself]",society

11,Jonathan Sacks,"Religion is the best antidote to the individualism of the consumer age. The idea that society can do without it flies in the face of history and, now, evolutionary biology.","[best, history, age]",society
12,Jonathan Sacks,"Britain, relative to the U.S., is a highly secular society. Philanthropy alone cannot fill the gap left by government cutbacks. And the sources of altruism go deep into our evolutionary past.","[alone, deep, past]",society

20,Jean-Bertrand Aristide,"The structure of apartheid is still rooted in the Haitian society. When you have apartheid, you don't see those behind the walls. That is the reality of Haiti.","[reality, see, you]",society
21,Agyness Deyn,"Not just in modeling, but in society, there's so much pressure about what a woman should be, and, of course, it's just so unobtainable. You can never become that thing, because it's such a projection.","[woman, modeling, pressure]",society
22,Jimmy Reid,Profit is the sole criterion used by the establishment to evaluate economic activity. From the rat race to lame ducks. The vocabulary in vogue is a give-away. It's more reminiscent of a human menagerie than human society.,"[race, economic, vocabulary]",society
23,Joni Eareckson Tada,The hallmark of a healthy society has always been measured by how it cares for the disadvantaged.,"[healthy, always, measured]",society
24,Steven Johnson,It is extraordinary how safe flying has become.

25,Tony Judt,"As citizens of a free society, we have a duty to look critically at our world. But if we think we know what is wrong, we must act upon that knowledge.","[knowledge, world, free]",society
