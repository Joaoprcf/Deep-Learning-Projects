4,Douglas Wilder,"Greece's European neighbors were able step in and bolster the weak foundation on which Greece's free-spending budget was based.

19,Tim Tebow,Being outspoken about my faith isn't just something that I do; it's who I am because my faith isn't just a little piece of my life. It is my life. It's not a question of whether I'm outspoken about it or not. I'm definitely not ashamed of it.,"[life, i am, my life]",faith
