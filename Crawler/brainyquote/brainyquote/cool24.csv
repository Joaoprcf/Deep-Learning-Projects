0,Emily Browning,There have been a few times when I've read a script and it's really cool but the girl character's just kind of pathetic. It's not going to do me any favours just being 'the girl' in a cool movie.,"[character, girl, me]",cool
1,Miranda Cosgrove,"Sometimes I get kind of bored if I go like a month or so and I'm not doing anything. At first I'm like, 'Cool, I'll have a little time off and I'll get to hang out with friends,' but then after a little while goes by I'm like, 'Oh,' and I really wish that I could go back and start doing work again.","[work, time, friends]",cool
2,Chord Overstreet,"I love John Stamos. John's a really friendly, cool dude.","[love, friendly, dude]",cool
3,Sheila E.,"It was very cool to be honored and be acknowledged in that way for the first time ever, being nominated for an Emmy.","[time, way, first]",cool
4,Curtis Jackson,"I like to sort through music and see whatever pops out to me or inspires me. If I could have a production team going and kind of mix records with me, that would be cool; to take the records and have them sound the way I want them to sound. But I'd rather sort though music to find them things.","[music, team, me]",cool
5,Curtis Jackson,"My grandmother, she's been the positive portion of my life the entire time. She raised us Baptist, and when I got old enough to say I didn't want to go to church, she didn't force me. She was cool.","[life, positive, time]",cool
6,Sharon Van Etten,I have a day job Monday to Friday. I work at a record label in Brooklyn called Ba Da Bing. It's a great indie label and I listen to music all day. I meet people online and find out about the cool new music blogs.,"[music, work, great]",cool
7,James Badge Dale,"I got beat up by the comic-book kids when I was younger! They were cooler than me. Talk about levels of geekdom, I was a couple rungs below the kids who read comic books. Yeah. Not so cool, man.","[man, me, talk]",cool
8,Jacques Audiard,"Cool? Am I cool? I don't know, but I hope my characters are cool, in the sense of iconic. That's my job, at its very essence.","[hope, job, know]",cool
9,Kathryn Minshew,"When The Daily Muse initially wanted to launch a job board, our first ideas were insanely (and needlessly) complex. We wanted to integrate with social networks, gather rich personal data to build predictive algorithms, and put together numerous cool visualization tools before launching out to the world. We were just sure users would love it!","[love, daily, together]",cool
10,Jencarlos Canela,"When we put music on, he kind of kicks in the belly, and it's cool to see how he's not even born yet, but he's already responding to the music. When I talk to him, he kicks as well. It's a very deep connection that I have with my son already and he's not even born. So I'm loving it.","[music, deep, son]",cool
11,Scott Ian,"I'm just not a big fan of the too-cool-for-school indie world. Metal bands have never been invited or been able to be part of the cool kids, and I like it that way.","[world, metal, way]",cool
12,Gabriel Iglesias,"I almost bought a DeLorean the other day just because. If I see something that I think is cool and I like it, I'll go for it.","[day, think, see]",cool
13,Robert Sheehan,"I never aspired to be in a band, but being onstage is a very cool feeling. It's like you're the lord of the room. It's hard to croon and run around doing big scissor kicks while also trying to play, though. I'm still mastering that.","[trying, doing, band]",cool
14,Ben Schwartz,"When I do the roles, when I'm in the room and auditioning, I'll ask the director if they're cool with me adding stuff, or just improvising while we're doing it. And I would say, like, 90 percent of the time, they say, 'Absolutely.'","[time, me, doing]",cool
15,Fred Armisen,"Prince is my favorite ever. I've liked Prince since... It's been a really long time. Even in junior high. I used to only like punk for a while, and I had all these rules for what kinds of groups were cool, and who was not cool, but as soon as I saw this one Prince video... It just broke all those rules. I was like, 'I love this no matter what.'","[love, time, rules]",cool
16,Joss Whedon,"I am not a fan of referencing your own work when it's in a different universe than what you're doing. That, to me, is a wink at the audience, and winking isn't actually cool when you're not, like, 10.","[work, i am, universe]",cool
17,Trent Reznor,iTunes kind of feels like Sam Goody to me. I don't feel cool when I go there. I'm tired of seeing John Mayer's face pop up.,"[me, tired, face]",cool
18,Trent Reznor,"'Yeezus,' I really love it. I think the sound of it is cool.","[love, think, sound]",cool
19,Luke Bryan,"I just cut songs I love and that represent what I want to say. And if it crosses over, that's very flattering. It's cool to know that with people listening to rock and rap, I'm sitting on their iPods along with that stuff.","[love, listening, people]",cool
20,Lance Gross,Working with Angela Bassett is by far the best. I've watched and admired her for years. I'm very intrigued by her work. She's so cool. I still call her 'Mom' when I see her.,"[best, work, mom]",cool

23,John Simm,"When I got to 40, I was happy. Now I can wear what I like, listen to what I like, don't have to try and be cool. I'm someone's dad and it doesn't matter any more. That's an enormous freedom.","[freedom, happy, dad]",cool
24,Rafe Spall,"As an actor, you try and be cool, but one of the reasons you become an actor is because you're a film fan. And then you're like, 'Oh my God, Ridley Scott just spoke to me!'","[god, me, try]",cool
25,Bonnie McKee,"If I know I will be working with someone and they are not keen with writing with a girl, I like to be non-threatening and cool so they will trust me. It's a thought process of who work and how I want to present myself.","[work, trust, myself]",cool
