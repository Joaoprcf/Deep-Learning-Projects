1,Oscar Isaac,"I've done movies I'm very proud of, but there's always a sense of: 'Come see this shiny new car!' The question I hate the most is: 'Why should people see it?'","[car, hate, people]",movies
2,Dwayne Johnson,"I have an immense amount of respect for acting. I've always loved movies and was always fascinated by movie-making. But to become an actor, I wanted to commit myself.","[respect, myself, loved]",movies
3,Jordan Ladd,"All I know is movies; I went to school, but movies are my reference point for everything. I figured I'd have to P.A. or intern in the art department. Because the filmmaking process is so many people creating to make one piece of magic, so I've always wanted to be involved. With the acting, I doubted it.","[art, school, people]",movies
4,Michael Douglas,"With 'Black Rain,' I spent a lot of time with homicide detectives, and I spent a lot of time with different brokers on 'Wall Street.' It helps get the rhythm of the piece and the tone, and how overplayed or underplayed it might be. That's also the magic of movies: You get to hang out and live these different lives.","[time, rain, black]",movies
5,Isaac Hayes,"I've been around a long time, and when I was at the top of the hill, I was very ahead of my time!

So, rather than compromise my artistic integrity, I concentrated on movies.","[music, time, integrity]",movies
6,Warren Spector,"In cartoons, in movies, time passes differently. There are flashbacks and flashfowards.","[time, time passes]",movies
7,J. D. Salinger,"You take somebody that cries their goddam eyes out over phoney stuff in the movies, and nine times out of ten they're mean bastards at heart.","[eyes, heart, you]",movies
8,Maddie Ziegler,"I love dancing just because I've done it my whole life and it's definitely what I want to do. I feel like, I want to train with acting and do movies. Those two are my main priorities. I definitely want to be able to sing and model, too. I definitely love those, too.","[life, love, priorities]",movies
9,J Allard,I don't worry about great visuals that they showed that weren't actually running on real hardware. It doesn't matter. Gamers don't make their purchase decisions based on movies that were shown in May for products that come out in March.,"[great, decisions, worry]",movies
10,Sutton Foster,I think everybody has something that takes them away or makes them happier. To some people it's baseball or sports or knitting or the movies.,"[sports, baseball, people]",movies
11,Mel Brooks,A cinema villain essentially needs a moustache so he can twiddle with it gleefully as he cooks up his next nasty plan.,"[plan, villain, cinema]",movies
12,Steven Spielberg,"The most amazing thing for me is that every single person who sees a movie, not necessarily one of my movies, brings a whole set of unique experiences. Now, through careful manipulation and good storytelling, you can get everybody to clap at the same time, to hopefully laugh at the same time, and to be afraid at the same time.","[time, good, amazing]",movies
13,Tim Burton,Movies are like an expensive form of therapy for me.,"[me, therapy, like]",movies

19,Jonah Hill,"All my friends were in college when I was making 'Superbad.' We were drinking beer and watching movies and eating pizza. It wasn't like I was going to nice restaurants or anything like that, and I lived like a frat guy. Eventually it was time to grow up, be healthy and be responsible. You can't live like a kid forever, you know?","[time, college, beer]",movies
20,Jason Reitman,I hate movies that tell people what to think. I'm proud that Democrats thought 'Thank You For Smoking' was their film and Republicans thought it was theirs. I'm proud that pro-choice people thought 'Juno' was their film and pro-life people thought it was theirs.,"[hate, thank you, people]",movies
21,Maya Angelou,"I never expected anyone to take care of me, but in my wildest dreams and juvenile yearnings, I wanted the house with the picket fence from June Allyson movies. I knew that was yearning like one yearns to fly.","[dreams, me, care]",movies
22,Drew Goddard,"With horror movies, a bigger budget is actually your enemy. You want to feel the rough edges, the handmade quality to good horror films. It's a genre that benefits from not having everything at your disposal.","[good, quality, enemy]",movies
23,Casey Neistat,The idea that somebody would go to my YouTube channel and want to watch movies and then be subjected to some terrible car commercial - I don't like that.,"[car, want, youtube]",movies
