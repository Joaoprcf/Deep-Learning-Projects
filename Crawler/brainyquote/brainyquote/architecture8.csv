3,Thom Mayne,"Architecture is involved with the world, but at the same time it has a certain autonomy. This autonomy cannot be explained in terms of traditional logic because the most interesting parts of the work are non-verbal. They operate within the terms of the work, like any art.","[work, time, art]",architecture
4,Audre Lorde,"Poetry is not only dream and vision; it is the skeleton architecture of our lives. It lays the foundations for a future of change, a bridge across our fears of what has never been before.","[change, future, poetry]",architecture
5,Rem Koolhaas,"People can inhabit anything. And they can be miserable in anything and ecstatic in anything. More and more I think that architecture has nothing to do with it. Of course, that's both liberating and alarming.","[people, nothing, miserable]",architecture
6,Richard Rogers,Architecture is about public space held by buildings.,"[space, buildings, about]",architecture
7,Oscar Niemeyer,"Architecture will always express the technical and social progress of the country in which it is carried out. If we wish to give it the human content that it lacks, we must participate in the political struggle.","[progress, struggle]",architecture

11,Joseph Altuzarra,"In architecture and interiors, as well as fashion, there is an interaction that is both functional and aesthetic.","[fashion, interaction]",architecture
12,Peter Zumthor,"I work a little bit like a sculptor. When I start, my first idea for a building is with the material. I believe architecture is about that. It's not about paper, it's not about forms. It's about space and material.","[work, believe, building]",architecture
13,Peter Zumthor,"In a society that celebrates the inessential, architecture can put up a resistance, counteract the waste of forms and meanings and speak its own language.","[society, language, speak]",architecture

22,Philip Johnson,The future of architecture is culture.,"[future, culture]",architecture

24,Ron Eglash,"I started collecting aerial photographs of Native American and South Pacific architecture; only the African ones were fractal. And if you think about it, all these different societies have different geometric design themes that they use. So Native Americans use a combination of circular symmetry and fourfold symmetry.","[design, american, think]",architecture
25,Ludwig Mies van der Rohe,Never talk to a client about architecture. Talk to him about his children. That is simply good politics. he will not understand what you have to say about architecture most of the time.,"[time, children, good]",architecture
