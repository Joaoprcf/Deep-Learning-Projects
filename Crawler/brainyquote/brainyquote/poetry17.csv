0,Fred Durst,"You know, in my music career there was a moment where the irony was just so heavy. There were people in my audience that were the reason I developed neuroses.

6,Macklemore,"Reading a piece of poetry with no beat in front of 20 people is way more challenging than rocking for 10,000 people.","[reading, people, way]",poetry
7,Marcus Mumford,I think it was T.S. Eliot who talked about good poetry being felt before it's understood. I believe that. There are some bands where I love their lyrics but I don't have a clue what they're on about.,"[love, good, believe]",poetry

9,Julianna Baggott,"And I know I'm supposed to feel guilty for wanting people to buy my books... and books in general? Novels and poetry, they belong to the realm of art. How dirty of us to try to hawk art! But, after a decade of hand-wringing and apologies, I can't quite muster the guilt anymore.","[art, people, know]",poetry

12,Terry Eagleton,"Poetry is the most subtle of the literary arts, and students grow more ingenious by the year at avoiding it. If they can nip around Milton, duck under Blake and collapse gratefully into the arms of Jane Austen, a lot of them will.","[year, duck, grow]",poetry

19,Amanda Plummer,"I had a strong propensity, which I still have, to be invisible. In grade school, I'd try to disappear and become formless. I lived in a very imaginary world.
