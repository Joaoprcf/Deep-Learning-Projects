0,Jude Deveraux,"My university degree is in art and, yes, I do a lot of drawing for all my books.

2,Philip Johnson,"Concrete you can mold, you can press it into - after all, you haven't any straight lines in your body. Why should we have straight lines in our architecture?

9,Virginia Postrel,"A world of few choices, whether in jeans or mates, is a world in which individual differences become sources of alienation, unhappiness, even self-loathing. If no jeans fit, you'll feel uncomfortable or inferior. If no housing developments reflect your taste for unique architecture, you'll write screeds against philistine mass culture.","[culture, choices, unique]",architecture
10,Ludwig Mies van der Rohe,"Our utilitarian structures will mature into architecture only when, through their fulfillment of function, they become carriers of the will of the age.","[age, mature, fulfillment]",architecture

Everything else that fulfils a function is to be excluded from the domain of art.,"[art, small, nothing]",architecture
