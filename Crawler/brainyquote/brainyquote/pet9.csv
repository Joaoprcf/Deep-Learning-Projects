0,"Philippe Cousteau, Jr.",One of my big pet peeves is single-use plastic bags. I think it's one of the stupidest ideas in the world.,"[world, ideas, think]",pet
1,Andy Rooney,The average dog is a nicer person than the average person.,"[dog, person, average]",pet
2,Kate Beckinsale,"I have more pet peeves than anybody: people talking in the movie theater, people eating in the movie theater loudly, people being rude, people making noise when you're supposed to be asleep, like drilling noises outside. I could be here all day.","[day, people, eating]",pet
3,Julia Glass,I was ridiculed in public school for being smart. A teacher's pet.,"[teacher, school, smart]",pet
4,Cesar Millan,"Owners lavish love on their pets, which is why so many go from non-aggressive pups to being out of control when they're older. People just don't realise their dog must respect them as leader of the pack.","[love, respect, leader]",pet
5,Rachael Ray,"We created a line of pet food called Nutrish that's made to human standards, and 100 percent of the proceeds go to animal rescue. One of our top-tier donors is the ASPCA, and they help us challenge animal shelters all across the country to get more animals placed in homes.","[food, challenge, help]",pet
6,America Ferrera,"I have a lot of trouble understanding how people see me as a celebrity. I work 14 hours a day, and then I just want to talk to my family, see the people I love, pet my dog, and go to bed. I'm not looking to be best friends with or emulate a celebrity.","[love, family, best]",pet
7,Timothy Simons,"I'm a dog person, but I don't have a pet.","[dog, person]",pet
8,Mike Ditka,There's just me and my wife and a dog and we feed him Healthy Choice also.,"[dog, wife, me]",pet
9,Patrick Stump,"I think you can totally be a totally normal kid from the suburbs of Chicago and go off and play shows. It's one of those things that when you go home, you're still the nerd you were when you left, and your parents still get to yell at you about cleaning up your room, and your girlfriend still drags you to the pet store.","[home, parents, think]",pet
10,Damon Lindelof,"I saw myself as a teacher's pet but with a little of Ed Haskell mixed in. I was the teacher's pet, but that didn't mean that I was trying to pull one over.","[teacher, myself, trying]",pet
11,Caroline Knapp,"Before you get a dog, you can't quite imagine what living with one might be like; afterward, you can't imagine living any other way.","[dog, living, way]",pet
12,Caroline Knapp,"The kinds of roles dogs fill can be hard to come by in human relationships. We touch the dog or the pet at whim. There is a lack of self-consciousness and a fluidity to it that is absent from most human relationships. If someone acted that way to you, you'd feel claustrophobic pretty quickly. It's a boundary violation.","[dog, dogs, someone]",pet
13,Elizabeth Marshall Thomas,People didn't think animals thought or remembered or had minds! They most certainly do: any pet owner knows more than a lot of scientists about animals.,"[people, thought, animals]",pet
14,Tracey Emin,"I really love animals. My cat is my little soul mate. He's not just a cat, he's my friend.","[love, soul, animals]",pet
15,Anna Held,"My little dog, he did not get ill. It is so funny that people get ill on a boat and dogs do not.","[funny, dog, people]",pet
16,Chelsea Cain,"You know what I hate? I hate people who give me plants. The whole giving someone plants - it's like giving someone a pet. I'm giving you responsibility, I'm giving you a thing that you now have to take care of for, like, a year until it dies, and then I'm giving you sadness and guilt.","[giving, responsibility, hate]",pet
17,Michelle Malkin,Environmentalists hate sprawl - except when it comes to the size of their expansive pet legislation on Capitol Hill.,"[hate, size, legislation]",pet
18,Cam Newton,What happens when you take a lion out of the safari and try to take him to your place of residence and make him a house pet? It ain't going to happen. That's the type of person that I am. I'm that lion.,"[i am, lion, happen]",pet
19,Sebastian Maniscalco,"One of my biggest pet peeves is when a guy's wearing flip-flop sandals, which I don't understand. Men's feet are disgusting to begin with, but now they're on display when I try to go out for a nice steak at a restaurant, and I have to sit there and look at some guy's hoof? I don't get it. I don't understand it.","[men, feet, nice]",pet
20,Michael Nutter,"If you have a deep-seated need to be loved and admired every day, you shouldn't be in politics. You should go work at a pet store.","[work, politics, day]",pet
21,Thornton Wilder,Many who have spent a lifetime in it can tell us less of love than the child that lost a dog yesterday.,"[love, dog, child]",pet
22,Loretta Swit,Don't buy furs: that's No. 1. You can start with that. Then spay and neuter your pets. We destroy millions of them a year. Go to an animal shelter for a cat or dog. And read a book about how to care properly for your particular pet.,"[dog, book, year]",pet
23,Aurora,"I really want a pet, and I really love animals.","[love, animals, want]",pet
24,Greg Mottola,"I have a little bit of a pet peeve about how the middle class is depicted in movies. I feel like they tend to be either depicted in a very sentimental way, where everybody has a heart of gold except for the villains you're supposed to hiss at, or there's a sort of indie-style version... When it's done well, it's brilliant, it's 'Blue Velvet.'","[heart, blue, gold]",pet
25,Billy Connolly,My parents used to take me to the pet department and tell me it was a zoo.,"[parents, me, zoo]",pet
